<p><strong>Enspiral is a network of people who support each other to do meaningful work.</strong></p>
<p>Or at least that's one way to define what Enspiral is. Check out <a href="https://enspiral.com">our website</a> for more context. You might also be inspired by our blog <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales">Enspiral Tales</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lScGElP49Jc">this video</a> created at Enspiral Summer Fest 2018.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://enspiral.substack.com"><strong>monthly newsletter</strong></a> is a great way to receive updates from our network.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-handbook"><a class="header" href="#about-this-handbook">About This Handbook</a></h2>
<p>This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral members, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. <strong>The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.</strong></p>
<p>Our handbook is designed as an <strong>always relevant living document</strong>. The handbook is constantly changing, and certain links point towards internal documents which contain the most up-to-date information. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! <a href="guides/contributing.html">Find out more about editing the handbook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>
<p>The book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="agreements/"><strong>Agreements</strong></a> are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.</li>
<li><a href="guides/"><strong>Guides</strong></a> explain in practical terms how we do stuff, for example <a href="guides/comms_guidelines.html">what communications tools to use</a> and <a href="/guides/newcomers.html">how to navigate the experience of being a newcomer</a>. Any Enspiral Contributor can change these.</li>
<li><a href="nodes/"><strong>Nodes</strong></a> lists formal subgroups within our network</li>
<li><a href="working-groups/"><strong>Working Groups</strong></a> are where we do work on the network.</li>
<li><a href="foundation/"><strong>Enspiral Foundation</strong></a> - the central node in the network. The <a href="foundation/board.html">Board</a>, <a href="foundation/ops-scope.html">Ops Team</a>, <a href="foundation/comms-role.html">Comms person</a>, and <a href="ventures/">Ventures</a> all have some formal arrangement with the Foundation, which is owned by Foundation Shareholders.</li>
<li><a href="money/"><strong>Money</strong></a> - a lot of what makes Enspiral special is how we deal with money. Read more about those processes in this chapter.</li>
<li><a href="ventures.html"><strong>Ventures</strong></a> - the companies started from the network.</li>
<li><a href="/resources.html"><strong>Resources</strong></a> - a list of useful links</li>
<li><a href="archive/"><strong>Archive</strong></a> compiles outdated info from previous iterations of this handbook for future reference.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agreements"><a class="header" href="#agreements">Agreements</a></h1>
<p>Agreements are documents which define important processes at Enspiral. They are the legislation which govern the rules of how we operate. The process for creating and changing Agreements is defined in our <a href="agreements/../agreements/decisions.html">Decisions Agreement</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="board-agreement"><a class="header" href="#board-agreement">Board Agreement</a></h1>
<h2 id="context"><a class="header" href="#context">Context</a></h2>
<p>This agreement sets out the roles and responsibilities of the Enspiral Foundation Board and the powers granted to the <a href="agreements//foundation/board.html">Directors of Enspiral Foundation Ltd</a>. As a <a href="https://www.business.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/3415611">registered limited liability company</a>, Enspiral Foundation Ltd is legally required to have a board of directors and a chairperson.</p>
<p>Enspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so our approach is a light board, with a narrow focus.</p>
<h2 id="roles--responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#roles--responsibilities">Roles &amp; Responsibilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure Enspiral Foundation Ltd is fully compliant with New Zealand laws and regulations, and its company constitution.</li>
<li>Maintain an overview of current finances, long term financial view, and adequate reserves (as defined in the <a href="agreements/../agreements/financial.html">Financial Agreement</a>).</li>
<li>Decide what kind of financial activity can go through the Foundation, and oversee activity in the Foundation’s accounts.</li>
<li>Oversee all agreements between Enspiral Foundation Ltd and other entities (including Enspiral Ventures and external organisations), such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs - <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memorandum-of-understanding-MOU-or-MoU">see definition</a>), service contracts, fundholding arrangements, etc.</li>
<li>Make recommendations about substantive decisions involving Enspiral Foundation Ltd and its assets, consulting with the shareholders and wider network.</li>
<li>Report quarterly on its activities to the shareholders and wider network.</li>
<li>Decide on the contents of <a href="agreements/../agreements/nodes.html">Node Requirements</a> using an <a href="agreements/../decisions.html">Advice Decision</a>.</li>
<li>Approve new <a href="agreements/../agreements/nodes.html">Enspiral Nodes</a> and decomission inactive / rogue Nodes.</li>
<li>Protect the Enspiral brand and ensure the Enspiral Foundation has ultimate control over Enspiral brand assets and social media accounts.</li>
<li>Add / Remove members who are not part of a node to the network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selection--composition"><a class="header" href="#selection--composition">Selection &amp; Composition</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Foundation Stewards and existing directors are expected to actively maintain a diverse board in keeping with the <a href="agreements/../agreements/diversity.html">Diversity Agreement</a>.</li>
<li>Enspiral currently has no quota or strict compositional requirements of the board as we do not want to limit the spectrum of diversity considered.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="processes"><a class="header" href="#processes">Processes</a></h2>
<p>Defined by the company Constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directors not disqualified under the Companies Act can be appointed by the shareholders of Enspiral Foundation Ltd with 75% support.</li>
<li>Directors can be removed by the shareholders of Enspiral Foundation Ltd with 75% support.</li>
<li>There will be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 directors at any one time.</li>
<li>The Directors must elect one of their number as chairperson of the Board.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further defined by this agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The board of directors will meet at least quarterly.</li>
<li>Directors serve a term of a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years.</li>
<li>Decisions about appointing and removing directors will be made in the Foundation Stewards Loomio group.</li>
<li>Any Foundation Steward may nominate a new Director.</li>
<li>All directors must become an Enspiral member, in order to have access and context on network activity.</li>
<li>The Chair is selected by a 'paper, scissor, rock' process (best 2 out of 3), with the loser becoming the Chair of board for 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emergency-powers"><a class="header" href="#emergency-powers">Emergency Powers</a></h2>
<p>Under New Zealand law, the Board can take extreme unilateral action, a power Enspiral aims to apply only in rare emergency situations, such as the following risk areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial bankruptcy or solvency risk</li>
<li>Illegal conduct and legal disputes</li>
<li>Extreme brand/reputation risk</li>
<li>Breakdown of normal decision-making processes</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases the board has powers including liquidating the company, terminating contracts, disabling online platforms, commandeering funds, and any other actions the directors deem necessary to meet their legal responsibilities and allowed under the Companies Act.</p>
<h2 id="expectations"><a class="header" href="#expectations">Expectations</a></h2>
<p>Directors will:</p>

<li>Regularly participate in Enspiral's online and offline collaboration spaces, such as Loomio discussions, members meetings, and retreats.</li>
<li>Make themselves available to answer questions and hear concerns from anyone at Enspiral regarding the Enspiral Foundation, and their roles and responsibilities as board members.</li>

<p>{% hint style="info" %}</p>
<p>Brand WG is currently "inactive". Approval process in this agreement should be updated.</p>
<p>{% endhint %}</p>
<p><em>Note: this agreement is not about ‘branded Enspiral ventures’ or Enspiral associated ventures/companies. For now potential ventures go through the venture process. We have identified that that work needs wider input and alignment with the people working on clarifying Enspiral ventures.</em></p>
<p>This agreement is explicitly for anyone to use the Enspiral brand to align with their project, initiative, venture etc and get the right support and help they need to make it happen.</p>
<p>‘X by Enspiral’ can be used for things like… 'supported by, powered by, associated with, sponsored by...</p>
<p>Under this agreement to use the brand in this way all you need to do is:</p>
<p><strong>(1:) Articulate your initiative</strong> <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/imQs3ZenqFz9x4ls1"><strong>by using this form</strong></a></p>
<p>The purpose of this form is to act as a risk register and ask some reflective questions that further the thinking of the person behind the project, whilst providing some rigour of thinking to people outside of the project.</p>
<p><strong>(2:) Gain approval from 3 members of the working group.</strong></p>
<p>This will require you to reach out and chat about your idea with at least 3 people in the Brand Working group. It’s a good chance to circulate your idea in the network, gain momentum for it and also get valuable feedback to see risks, issues and opportunities you might not have seen yet.</p>
<p>When you’ve got this crew behind you, you can go for it and use the brand on your amazing, innovative, risky-as-hell or safe-as-houses new 'Supported by Enspiral' project.</p>
<p>If you fail spectacularly and publicly, you'll have our support. Innovation is messy - and running with clear intent and failing is a great thing. If you succeed, awesome. No doubt the network will continue to support you.</p>

<p>{% hint style="info" %}</p>
<p>At the moment Enspiral has no active Catalysts. However, this social technology developed by Enspiral is still relevant in creating impact in the world. If you want to learn more about the role of the catalyst, here's <a href="https://youtu.be/SIlBobGS-Q8">an interview with our ex-catalyst Joriam</a>, exploring the role the Catalyst plays inside a network.</p>
<p>{% endhint %}</p>
<h2 id="context-1"><a class="header" href="#context-1">Context</a></h2>
<p>In chemistry, a Catalyst is an agent of change, used in small amounts relative to the reactants, which reduces the amount of energy required to create a reaction, and activates the rest of the system without itself getting consumed.</p>
<p>With Catalysts at Enspiral, we are attempting to take the function of executive leadership, share it across multiple agents, and cycle many people through the role under a set time limit. The goal is to maintain a rhythm of evolution at Enspiral by inviting contribution, participation, and action, whilst reducing the friction people encounter trying to make changes and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="roles--responsibilities-1"><a class="header" href="#roles--responsibilities-1">Roles &amp; Responsibilities</a></h2>
<p>As leaders, Catalysts are responsible for defining and managing their own work. The specific functions below are intended to only occupy a small fraction of a Catalysts committed time, with the rest spent on their self-directed work programme.</p>
<p><strong>Support Working Groups and Make Their Work Easier</strong> The primary responsibility of Catalysts is to catalyze working groups and help them be more productive. This can involve activities like strategy setting, co-facilitation, conflict resolution, fund raising and recruitment. Catalysts exist to support the work, not do the work.</p>
<p><strong>Interface Between Working Groups and the Network</strong> Catalysts are a focal point in the attention economy. They are responsible for maintaining a list of active working groups and ensuring their activities are communicated succintly to the wider network. They are also responsible for supporting people who wish to join working groups find somewhere to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain a Prioritised Network Improvements List</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/b/btHeb35m/enspiral-improvements-board">The Improvements Board</a> is the catalysts responsibility. They are responsible for keeping it up to date and ensuring that working groups activity is clearly represented and that ideas for new improvements are frequently reviewed and considered.</p>
<p><strong>Hold Working Group Rhythms</strong> Catalysts are responsible for facilitating key rhythms and decisions for the ecosystem of working groups as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="processes-1"><a class="header" href="#processes-1">Processes</a></h2>
<p><strong>Appointment</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="agreements/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/archive/catalysts.html">Catalyst support working group</a> is responsible for selecting and supporting catalysts.</p>
<p><strong>Resourcing</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="agreements/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/archive/catalysts.html">Catalyst support working group</a> is responsible for raising funds through cobudget or other means to fund on-going catalyst work.</p>
<h2 id="expectations-1"><a class="header" href="#expectations-1">Expectations</a></h2>
<p>Each Catalyst will have their own style of leadership, and diverse approaches are strongly encouraged. However, there are some guiding principles we expect all Catalysts to follow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gentle</strong> - exercise power with others, not over others.</li>
<li><strong>Firm</strong> - hold people to their commitments, especially yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Selfless</strong> - subsume your personal motivations to those of the group.</li>
<li><strong>Kind</strong> - care for the people, care for yourself. Ask for and offer support.</li>
<li><strong>Ambitious</strong> - aim for high standards in both yourself and others.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusive</strong> - consistently create opportunities for all kinds of people to engage.</li>
<li><strong>Catalysing</strong> - consciously develop leadership capacity in yourself and others.</li>
<li><strong>Holistic</strong> - regard the bigger picture, the longer term, and the network as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decisions-agreement"><a class="header" href="#decisions-agreement">Decisions Agreement</a></h1>
<p>This agreement defines how formal decisions are made at Enspiral. It identifies a number of different types of decision-making protocols, and describes processes for participating in formal decision making.</p>
<h2 id="context-2"><a class="header" href="#context-2">Context</a></h2>
<p>Enspiral is a network of highly autonomous individuals, teams, and ventures. As much as possible, we encourage people to make decisions for themselves.</p>
<p>Enspiral is also a network building shared commons, and pursuing shared aspirations, that call for collective agreements and commitments. There are a variety of situations where it is useful or necessary to make a formal decision as a group.</p>
<h2 id="decision-protocol-consensus"><a class="header" href="#decision-protocol-consensus">Decision Protocol: Consensus</a></h2>
<p>For formal decisions, Enspiral uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">consensus decision-making</a>, a methodology with a specific meaning and practice. Consensus does not mean unanimous agreement or engagement from everyone on all decisions. The key concept is consent (you can live with it), which is distinct from agreement (it’s your preference or first choice).</p>
<h2 id="agreements-1"><a class="header" href="#agreements-1">Agreements</a></h2>
<p><strong>Formal decisions with everyone are only intended to be used when they will have significant impact on the wider network</strong>. This Decision Agreement is the core agreement from which all others derive their mandate.</p>
<p>In order to enable efficient decision-making, provide clarity to participants, comply with laws, and protect the network, certain formal decisions are delegated to specific people, groups, or processes other than a consensus decision. This delegation is an Agreement and they are <a href="agreements/../agreements/README.html">documented in our Handbook</a>. Decisions to change existing Agreements or create new ones are made by everyone in the network together.</p>
<h2 id="decision-tool-loomio"><a class="header" href="#decision-tool-loomio">Decision Tool: Loomio</a></h2>
<p>At Enspiral, formal decisions are made using a software tool called <a href="http://www.loomio.org">Loomio</a>, which helps groups make collective decisions using constructive deliberation. This process is based on the principle that diverse perspectives can be synthesised to achieve better solutions that work for more people.</p>
<p>While making use of other channels (online and offline) to enrich input into a decision is strongly encouraged, the results on Loomio are considered the official outcome. This is so that we can keep a clear record and archive, and to ensure that everyone who desires to participate in a given decision-making process has the opportunity to make their voice heard.</p>
<p>Not every Loomio proposal constitutes a formal decision. Many Loomio proposals are created simply to gauge interest or share information. For the purposes of this Agreement, a “formal decision” is a clearly worded Loomio proposal seeking a specific mandate on behalf of the network.</p>
<h2 id="making-formal-decisions"><a class="header" href="#making-formal-decisions">Making Formal Decisions</a></h2>
<p><strong>Anyone can propose a formal decision at any time. We seek open, transparent decision-making and strive to enable the people who are affected by a decision to participate as fully as possible in making it</strong>. tries to make decisions with the widest possible circle of participants, while recognising the necessity and wisdom of delegating responsibility for certain decisions.</p>
<p>A formal decision is only required whenever there is a significant impact on the network. It is difficult to specify exact criteria for every case, so everyone is encouraged to use their best judgement to balance exercising autonomy with gaining shared understanding.</p>
<p>Formal decisions are needed for the following areas (some with the whole network, some with a subset of people or by a process which has been delegated by an Agreement).</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreements - creating new rules about how Enspiral works</li>
<li>Brand - using the Enspiral's logo and identity publicly</li>
<li>Money - spending collective funds or for actions that impact our financial outlook</li>
<li>Tools &amp; Processes - how the network as a whole will work and communicate</li>
<li>Relationships - commitments as a network with individuals or entities (such as invitations to membership, appointing directors, MOUs with ventures or other entities)</li>
<li>Buy-in &amp; Awareness - when seeking a shared sense of ownership and support from the network as a whole</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decision-types"><a class="header" href="#decision-types">Decision Types</a></h2>
<p>This agreement sets out the types of consensus decision making protocols that are used within . These protocols are named here so they can easily be referred to in other Agreements and contexts, and people can consider which is most appropriate for the situation.</p>
<p>The default for all formal decision making in is the Standard Decision.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left">Type</th><th style="text-align: left">Passing Criteria</th><th style="text-align: left">Engagement Threshold</th><th style="text-align: left">Minimum Timeframe</th><th style="text-align: left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>Additionally, we have other types of formal decisions for specific circumstances. When using any of the decision types below, it must be clearly specified in the proposal.</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="discussions--proposals"><a class="header" href="#discussions--proposals">Discussions &amp; Proposals</a></h2>
<p>Loomio decisions are generally preceded by a Loomio discussion. It is recommended to allow space for open discussion before starting a proposal, to give people an opportunity to be actively involved in shaping the context of the decision, and to share relevant information and opinions.</p>
<p>Any participant can raise a proposal, which describes a clear course of action or resolution. Once a proposal has been created, participants are asked to state a position.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left">position</th><th style="text-align: left">meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">YES</td><td style="text-align: left">You’re happy with the proposal.</td></tr>

<tr><td style="text-align: left">NO</td><td style="text-align: left">You think there might be a better alternative, but you’re willing to go with the group’s decision.</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">BLOCK</td><td style="text-align: left">You’ve got serious objections and you’ll be extremely unhappy if this proposal goes ahead.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="blocking"><a class="header" href="#blocking">Blocking</a></h2>
<p><strong>At Enspiral, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal proceeding in most cases. This places a considerable responsibility on someone blocking to deeply consider their choice, and on everyone involved to respect the right to block and to work toward a resolution.</strong></p>
<p>A decision to block should not be taken lightly, but if you feel strongly about an issue and really want to stop a proposal you actually need to block it, because simply disagreeing or arguing against is not a guarantee that it won't be passed.</p>
<p><strong>Blocking Policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place the good of the whole group above your own individual preferences.</li>
<li>You are not required to propose an alternative solution to raise a block, but you must articulate the nature of your block clearly so the group can understand the concern and work toward a resolution.</li>
<li>Simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking - you must be prepared to work collaboratively to try and reach a resolution, make time for conversations, and to help others understand the issue.</li>
<li>Blocks should only be used in cases where the blocker genuinely believes there is a significant risk of harm to the network, or that the proposal contravenes the fundamental values of Enspiral.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="decision-culture--practice"><a class="header" href="#decision-culture--practice">Decision Culture &amp; Practice</a></h2>
<p>While this document defines our formal decision making protocols, the effectiveness of our decision-making practice depends on our collective culture. The following principles have been found to be helpful in supporting formal decision-making at Enspiral.</p>
<p><strong>Your Participation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Share your genuine and honest views and opinions.</li>
<li>Be succinct and clear in your communication.</li>
<li>Modulate the volume of your contributions to leave space for equitable participation from others.</li>
<li>Practice empathy and ask questions. Listen to understand, not to find fault.</li>
<li>Actively engage in order to help the group make progress.</li>
<li>Be prepared to have your mind changed - don’t be overly attached to your ideas.</li>
<li>Consciously embrace diverse perspectives to reveal blind spots.</li>
<li>Ask for help if you are not adequately engaged or don't understand an issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enriching Engagement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open multiple channels to get well-rounded input (not just Loomio, not just online).</li>
<li>Involve people who are not in your geographical location and those you do not work with regularly.</li>
<li>If you encounter tension, conflict, or confusion, escalate communication to a higher bandwidth channel (Loomio to chat, chat to video, video to one-on-one, one-on-one to mediation by a third party), and then report outcomes back to the group.</li>
<li>Take considered acts of facilitation to improve the experience of the group overall (examples: inviting in those we have not yet heard from, clarifying and summarising points raised, suggesting good timing for a proposal, etc).</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diversity-agreement"><a class="header" href="#diversity-agreement">Diversity Agreement</a></h1>
<p>Enspiral is committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity within an equitable workplace where all people are respected and valued. Enspiral will take active steps to reflect the diversity of the communities it works in. This policy provides a framework to which all other policies should align. It provides direction to everyone at Enspiral.</p>
<p>Enspiral will better reach its overall goals if it is successful in systematically identifying and removing barriers to full participation in all aspects of our work. Increasing diversity has been consistently shown to help business succeed. It is essential for reaching both our financial and social goals.</p>
<p><strong>Enspiral will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>be guided by the principle that equity means more than treating people in the same way; it requires special measures and the accommodation of differences.</li>
<li>advocate for learning and development opportunities to raise awareness and build understanding of equity and diversity in practice.</li>
<li>not tolerate discriminatory behaviour, such as harassment, name-calling, and disparaging jokes, and will take responsibility for appropriately addressing such incidents.</li>
<li>include a commitment to diversity in the selection process for who we bring into our community.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the responsibility of everyone at Enspiral to ensure that we uphold its principles of equity and diversity in all its practices.</p>

<h3 id="context-3"><a class="header" href="#context-3">Context</a></h3>
<p>This agreement defines how Enspiral handles money as a collective, specifically the funds in the accounts of Enspiral. Our goals are to ensure legal compliance, financial solvency, and operational reliability, make financial flows across the network as transparent as possible, and direct significant resources to discretionary funds to be decided through participatory processes.</p>
<h2 id="type-of-funds"><a class="header" href="#type-of-funds">Type of Funds</a></h2>
<p>Money held by the foundation falls into the following two categories.</p>
<h4 id="core-fund"><a class="header" href="#core-fund">Core Fund</a></h4>
<p>The core fund is controlled by the Foundation Board. These funds are flagged for operational expenses and providing an economic runway for Enspiral.</p>
<p>The board is expected to maintain a viable level for the core fund account (e.g. minimum of 12 months of fixed expenses) and to periodically allocate any surplus to the approved collaborative funding processes of their choice.</p>
<h4 id="collaborative-funds"><a class="header" href="#collaborative-funds">Collaborative Funds</a></h4>
<p>Funds allocated to an approved collaborative funding process governed by the rules that define the specific process.</p>
<h2 id="income"><a class="header" href="#income">Income</a></h2>
<p>Enspiral receives income from individuals, companies, trusts or other entities. Income can be broken into the following categories:</p>
<h4 id="gifts"><a class="header" href="#gifts">Gifts</a></h4>
<p>All one-off gifts to the foundation go to the core funds.</p>
<h4 id="membership"><a class="header" href="#membership">Membership</a></h4>
<p>Except for membership fees collected directly by Enspiral Nodes, all recurring membership fees are considered global memberships and go to core funds. The board is responsible for setting global membership fee levels and processes via the membership fees guide.</p>
<h4 id="sponsorship"><a class="header" href="#sponsorship">Sponsorship</a></h4>
<p>A recurring sponsorship with Enspiral. All sponsorships have a written memorandum which outlines the terms of the sponsorship and where funds are allocated.</p>
<p>Sponsorship monies can be allocated to any fund, as defined by the sponsorship memorandum.</p>
<p>An agreement (in the form of a memorandum) with the Enspiral Board and the sponsor. The Board will sign off on and maintain a record of all memorandums.</p>
<h4 id="other-income"><a class="header" href="#other-income">Other income</a></h4>
<p>All other income is allocated to core funds.</p>
<h2 id="outgoings"><a class="header" href="#outgoings">Outgoings</a></h2>
<p>Money spent by the Foundation falls under the following categories.</p>
<h4 id="fixed-costs"><a class="header" href="#fixed-costs">Fixed Costs</a></h4>
<p>The board is responsible for managing the fixed costs of the network from core funds, which are expected to be kept at ‘minimum viable’ to ensure smooth operations of core processes for the  network.</p>
<h4 id="discretionary-costs"><a class="header" href="#discretionary-costs">Discretionary Costs</a></h4>
<p>All discretionary costs are managed through an approved collaborative funding process and taken from collaborative funds.</p>
<h4 id="emergency-costs"><a class="header" href="#emergency-costs">Emergency Costs</a></h4>
<p>The board can approve one-off expenditures from any fund when exercising <a href="agreements/../agreements/board.html#emergency-powers">their emergency powers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative-funding-processes"><a class="header" href="#collaborative-funding-processes">Collaborative Funding Processes</a></h2>
<p>A collaborative funding process must have a facilitator who takes responsibility for the process. Specifically the facilitator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the rules for the process are clearly documented and approved by the board</li>
<li>Budgeting for the process, including themselves running the process.</li>
<li>Facilitating the process</li>
<li>Reporting the outcomes to the network</li>
<li>Holding entities that receive funding accountable</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds may only be allocated to a collaborative funding process that has clearly documented rules that have been approved by the board. If no such rules have previously been defined, a proposal must be made to the board and approved.</p>
<h2 id="overall-compliance--reporting"><a class="header" href="#overall-compliance--reporting">Overall Compliance &amp; Reporting</a></h2>
<p>All financial compliance is managed at the discretion of the board. The board will provide a periodical financial report on Enspiral's funds/accounts balances and budget/financial forecast.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="foundation-stewards-agreement"><a class="header" href="#foundation-stewards-agreement">Foundation Stewards Agreement</a></h1>
<p>Any Enspiral member who has held their membership for more than one year can become a Foundation Steward.</p>
<p>Any Foundation Steward can request a formal share of the Enspiral Foundation.</p>
<p>The board is responsible for issuing shares to Foundation Stewards and will do so promptly unless doing so would cause legal or financial challenges for the foundation (e.g. more than 25% of shareholders being outside of New Zealand, or the number of shareholders growing so large we need expensive audits or legal advice).</p>
<p>If the board is unable to issue a share they will maintain a waitlist and issue shares on a first in, first out basis.</p>
<p>The intent is for each Foundation Steward to have an equal voice in shareholder resolutions, regardless of whether they own an actual share or not, and the shareholders are expected to vote in line with the wider Foundation Stewards group.</p>
<h2 id="foundation-stewards-are-expected-to"><a class="header" href="#foundation-stewards-are-expected-to">Foundation Stewards are expected to</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>actively participate in discussions about shareholder resolutions</li>
<li>steward the foundation in the best interests of the Enspiral network as a whole</li>
<li>promptly communicate with the ops team and the board as requested</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="formal-shareholders-are-expected-to"><a class="header" href="#formal-shareholders-are-expected-to">Formal shareholders are expected to</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>notify the ops team when their residency or tax situation changes</li>
<li>relinquish their share if keeping it would cause legal or financial problems for the foundation</li>
<li>vote in line with the wider foundation stewards group</li>
<li><strong>very promptly</strong> sign documents when requested by the ops team</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-note-on-numbers"><a class="header" href="#a-note-on-numbers">A note on numbers</a></h1>
<p><strong>The foundation stewards group are the ultimate power holder when it comes to determining the actions of the Enspiral Foundation</strong>. They have the power to rewrite the constitution, appoint the board of directors and control the Enspiral brand and money. It is important that this role is accessible to anyone who wants that responsibility and we have a wide and diverse group of stewards.</p>
<p>Also, the more formal shareholders we have then the more work there is for the ops team and the more unwieldy it becomes to manage. We have not placed any limits on the numbers of shareholders, or significant barriers in the way of people stepping in to this role and trust individuals to make the call on whether to request a share or not.</p>
<p>If you think the value of having your voice in this group is worth the administrative cost to the ops team of managing your share then step in. Likewise, if you feel like this group is working fine without your input, feel free to step out.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="enspiral-nodes-agreement"><a class="header" href="#enspiral-nodes-agreement">Enspiral Nodes Agreement</a></h1>
<p>An Enspiral node is a formal subgroup of Enspiral that has the power to manage their agreements, processes and finances independently.</p>
<p>The Foundation Board is responsible for creating and maintaining the Node Requirements (below) which are required to outline the requirements for starting, running and closing a node.</p>
<p>The Foundation Board has the power to approve requests for new Nodes and dissolve inactive / rogue Nodes.</p>
<h2 id="node-hosts"><a class="header" href="#node-hosts">Node Hosts</a></h2>
<p>Each node is expected to have at least two node hosts who are responsible for communicating with the Foundation Board and the wider network.</p>
<h2 id="joining--leaving-process"><a class="header" href="#joining--leaving-process">Joining / leaving process</a></h2>
<p>A node has the power to invite a new person to join Enspiral. Each member of a node is automatically a member of the global network.</p>
<p>A node also has the power to force one of their members to leave the network. While this power is expected to be used infrequently it is an important safeguard to protect the wider community.</p>
<h2 id="independent-finances"><a class="header" href="#independent-finances">Independent Finances</a></h2>
<p>A node may have finances independent from the Foundation and receive all membership fees from their members directly.</p>
<p>A node may also opt to have membership fees go directly to the foundation if they do not want the overheads of managing their own financial infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="multi-node-membership"><a class="header" href="#multi-node-membership">Multi-node membership</a></h2>
<p>An Enspiral member may be part of multiple Nodes. Membership of multiple nodes is encouraged and such people act as important connectors in the wider network.</p>
<h1 id="node-requirements"><a class="header" href="#node-requirements">Node Requirements</a></h1>
<p>The Board will update this agreement periodically with an advice process. This policy is a first iteration, if it hasn’t changed by Mar 2023 it is probably a bit stale.</p>
<p>Please talk to the Board early if you are considering starting a Node. When you’re ready to form a Node, fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tcWPO7LE78jSP8wmIH7r95cSyg-HhW5TGnOY4BOvyhQ/edit">this form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="nodes-must"><a class="header" href="#nodes-must">Nodes must:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>maintain communication with the Board</strong>. Nodes must name 2 formal <strong>representatives</strong> who will be responsive to Board requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>hold a gathering</strong> at least twice per year (online or in person). Members of other Enspiral Nodes must be welcome to join at least part of the gatherings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>maintain written documentation</strong> (e.g. handbook, wiki, shared doc), visible to the wider Enspiral network. Nodes inherits all Enspiral agreements, unless explicitly overwritten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>have a membership policy</strong>, e.g. who can invite someone to join? What is expected of them? On what grounds would they be asked to leave?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>communicate with Enspiral Ops</strong> within 5 working days when a member joins or leaves so we can maintain our global member database and add them to our global communication platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if financially enabled, Nodes must make <strong>finances transparent to the wider Enspiral network</strong>. Nodes are expected to charge members a subscription fee, though offering scholarships or subsidies where appropriate is acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure that all ownership and <strong>control over Enspiral branded</strong> domain names, trade marks, social media accounts is <strong>given to the Enspiral Foundation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive <strong>Board or Brand working group approval for any commercial use</strong> of the Enspiral brand except for running Enspiral gatherings.</p>

<p>Enspiral's value resides in the people and the relationships that make up our inspiring, changemaking network. We collectively strive to foster an increasingly open, inclusive and caring culture. The <a href="agreements/../archive/well-working-group.html">Well Working Group</a> will support this mission by developing network resources for constructive dialogue and co-working.</p>
<p><strong>We ask all Enspiral participants to support these Personal Conduct Guidelines:</strong></p>

<p><em>This agreement is about how we distribute the support and care tasks in the network and replaces the</em> <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/RIMCfuaT/"><em>former Stewardship Agreement</em></a> <em>in this respect.</em></p>
<p>Pods are small groups of people (4 to 5 is suggested) formed by people in Enspiral. Why Pods? It is important to distribute the tasks of <em>supporting and caring for each other</em> – and <em>building relationships</em> – around the network in a structured way. If you want to give and receive care in this network, then you have a responsibility to make that happen. Pods are one way in which the network is formally committed to supporting you in this. It's a good place to start, and this agreement ensures that a Pods Working Group will exist to facilitate that for you.</p>
<p>The Pods Working Group (Pods WG) is accountable for hosting the Pods formation process on a regular basis, once or more per year and communicating updates with the Network which could include status, progress and learnings.</p>
<p>For information about how we implement Pods, see the <a href="agreements/../guides/pods.html">Pods Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-working-groups"><a class="header" href="#types-of-working-groups">Types of Working Groups</a></h2>
<p>There are three types of working groups: informal, formal and financially enabled.</p>
<h3 id="informal"><a class="header" href="#informal">Informal</a></h3>

<h2 id="what-is-an-assembly-sprint"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-assembly-sprint">What is an Assembly Sprint?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Assembly Sprints are for organizing the most important discussions and decisions for this season into one place for us to have our say and move the network forwards</strong>. Your voice matters, and we invite you to bring your gifts to bear on our collective potential, unfolding the value of our collective, its resources (even its agreements, protocols, tools and shared understandings) and its current and future relationships.</p>
<p>The Assembly will typically involve a number of Loomio discussions and some community gatherings (sychronous meetings over video calls and in person when possible). Imagine months of Enspiralling concentrated into two weeks to help a bunch of conversations and proposals move forward.</p>
<p>Assembly Sprints will concentrate discussions and decisions—those that may have wide ramifications for many Enspiral stakeholders—over a period of (typically) two weeks, scheduled well in advance, for the purposes of inclusion, accessibility, transparency, and better synergising collective attention &amp; efforts.</p>
<p><strong>All Enspiral members are able to participate and have blocking power if they commit to the Assembly Sprint.</strong></p>
<h2 id="process-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#process-guidelines">Process Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>First, [eg. 2-3 months in advance], we would invite public submissions of concrete and/or specific proposals or topics where we imagine we’ll need to make a decision in the next year.</p>
<p>Then, [eg. 5-9 weeks in advance], the Assembly Working Group would use advice process to elect the decision-areas that are on the agenda—to be moved towards action during the time-boxed, asynchronous Assembly Sprint. [At least a month in advance], the Assembly Working Group will notify the network of what’s on the agenda for the particular dates, and will make an invitation for people to commit/ sign up to participate in the two week endeavour.</p>
<p>Then, it's time for Assembly Sprint!</p>
<h2 id="more-on-why-background"><a class="header" href="#more-on-why-background">More on Why/ Background</a></h2>
<p><strong>Decision-making 'assembly' sprints—if run regularly, a few times a year—could increase accessibility, supporting more people to be able to participate in shaping the network as their intrinsic motivation calls them to</strong>. By picking a short and specific time period (typically 2-4 weeks) several months in advance, and choosing which decision-areas are on the agenda, we can grow everyone's capacity to voice their values and share their wisdom on the issues that matter most to them.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will result in conditions of more coherence, transparency, and accountability in the process of decision-making that affects our Agreements, and will give each of us an opportunity to indicate the commitment that feels right for a given set of significant (or substantial) decisions in a given season. <em>@joshuavial outlined this approach in his document,</em> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxnXg1jYlf26Eakybj_AHWd8iKXbDYQx8klbRHi-PCI/edit#heading=h.ieqmtfr9n4fb"><em>4 Worlds (link → relevant header)</em></a>, <em>which you may have seen posted after the Members' meeting before last.</em></p>

<p>🎙 Here's a conversation about <a href="https://youtu.be/aNYEQKiioUU">blogging for Enspiral and writing online</a> with Rich Bartlett.</p>
<h2 id="context-4"><a class="header" href="#context-4">Context</a></h2>
<p>During the original Catalyst experiment, Gina started <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales">Enspiral Tales</a> - a Medium collection for blog stories written by Enspiral people.</p>
<p>Rich followed up with the “<a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/HMEnwIYz/greetings-from-the-fairy-blog-mother">Fairy Blog Mother</a>”. This was a bucket of money that anyone in the network can contribute to. Rich arbitrarily handed out money to people for writing, editing and illustrating blog posts. Creating Enspiral Content has been also funded in <a href="https://cobudget.com/enspiral/funding-round-2022/cl8rkemw8006509laj7vuh3sh">October '22 Cobudget Round</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZZO5vsM.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="content"><a class="header" href="#content">Content</a></h2>
<p>The content is diverse. We don’t need to have a strong editorial opinion about what kind of content to publish, as the internet decides what is interesting. Here’s some of the kinds of posts that seem to do well.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralised Leadership</strong></p>
<p>Between us we’re learning a lot about decentralised leadership. Alanna Krause <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/no-boss-does-not-mean-no-leadership-c4c97c660252#.7cy8qy6hl">writes about it</a>, Jessy Kate Schingler <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/transitioning-your-team-to-collaborative-governance-9c77e26f6bbf#.a0iri8vfv">writes about it</a>, Richard D. Bartlett <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/bootstrapping-a-bossless-organisation-in-3-easy-steps-afc653e8f5e6#.45fai8coj">writes about it</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/emerging-into-teal-through-working-out-loud-adc28e5867d6#.2gwq1w6yj">so does Susan Basterfield</a>. These pieces are really valuable to people trying to follow in Enspiral’s footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>Vision conjuring</strong></p>
<p>Some people do big epic visionary change-the-world pieces like Joshua Vial’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/hacking-capitalism-with-capped-returns-851937854a9e#.6qwthynxg">Hacking Capitalism with Capped Returns</a> and Edward West’s piece <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/doing-more-together-together-seeding-a-collaborative-technology-alliance-82243ea30d41#.6t5n8aan0">announcing the Collaborative Technology Alliance</a>. These are the kind of pieces a community can grow around.</p>
<p><strong>Experience sharing</strong></p>
<p>Some people share their experience of being in Enspiral, which is really helpful context for new folk. See Pete Jacobsen’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/a-baffling-journey-into-enspiral-f3cead054c8e#.h4xg4rr69">Baffling Journey Into Enspiral</a> or Hailey Cooperider’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/getting-to-know-enspiral-f3de9d3bb7d1#.5ynh9oqpf">reflections from her first Enspiral retreat</a>, Vivien Askey’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/jack-tolley-on-clarity-d1b6324240#.cmpfhtaof">interview with Jack Tolley</a>, Chloe Waretini’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/enspiral-catalyst-f322774ec75c#.ifvg7ragj">reflection on the first Catalyst experiment</a>,</p>
<p><strong>Practical lessons</strong></p>
<p>Then again some people share more practical lessons like Mix Irving’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/teaching-in-the-spiral-less-lecturing-more-co-creation-b56dba71a8c4#.q1jmpc2r7">Teaching in the Spiral: Less Lecturing, More Co-creating</a>, Chelsea Robinsons’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/feedback-feast-the-meal-you-ll-digest-for-a-year-67510cfc501b#.f7252k8i0">Feedback Feast</a>, Theodore Taptiklis’ on <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/a-new-cultural-tech-8a5a092035af#.pp7uv6qdm">Capturing a compelling story</a> and James Kiesel’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/building-a-better-nomad-things-i-learned-working-on-the-road-e9367bd9d55b#.hx6m3o4lz">piece on remote working</a> and Sam Rye on the essential tools in your <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/my-startup-stack-865da79b9adb#.m2c9qh866">Startup Stack</a>. The internet loves practical guides like this!</p>
<p><strong>Reflecting on events</strong></p>
<p>Blogging is a great way to digest events, e.g. Richard D. Bartlett’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/commons-technology-and-the-right-to-a-democratic-city-9dce13043f5b#.8x8e3csnm">epic summary of the Democratic Cities conference in Madrid</a>, Silvia Zuur’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/bioneers-da7d47638dde#.qgjo8h5we">review of Bioneers</a>, Tracey Ambrose’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/how-a-conference-i-thought-irrelevant-became-a-compass-for-my-future-a8afd5b609e3#.l2hf00bjz">review of OuiShare Fest</a>, Alina Seigfried’s piece about <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/rise-of-the-commons-fundamentals-of-p2p-economies-f737e6d8adfc#.e9phr3pbq">Michel Bauwens’ visit to Wellington</a>, and Derek Razo’s <a href="https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/beyond-poc21-from-a-moment-to-a-movement-46ae0177276c#.cu5jz138y">schemes after POC21 as the event morphed into a community</a>.</p>
<p>Events are easy to write about, and they tend to get a good level of attention because you can share them on the event hashtag. Event participants are often eager to read the reflections of other attendees.</p>
<h2 id="editing"><a class="header" href="#editing">Editing</a></h2>
<p>There’s no formal editorial system in place.</p>
<p>Anyone can write a piece on Medium and submit it to the publication for review. Technically, Rich, Alanna, Chloe, Derek, Seb and Gina have “editor” permissions so can approve or edit any submitted post. If you want your name on this list, talk to Rich.</p>
<p>Practically, Rich has the strongest editorial oversight - chat with him if you’re thinking of a post but not sure if it fits, or want any kind of encouragement. If you don’t know where to start, this short story about <a href="https://medium.com/@richdecibels/rich-s-general-theory-of-blogging-aa2cb502fbc#.jihqiqa33">writing the minimum viable post</a> might help. He’s currently operating on the principle that more contributors is good: let’s all get in the habit of sharing our lessons in public! Right now he's particularly interested in sharing stories about the challenges and tensions of working in this way, but you might be interested in something completely different and that is cool too.</p>
<h2 id="licensing-and-syndication"><a class="header" href="#licensing-and-syndication">Licensing and syndication</a></h2>
<p>Licensing is up to you. Medium allows you to choose a license, whether you want to reserve all, some, or no rights. <a href="https://medium.com/@Medium/licensing-your-work-on-medium-517fa7096e62#.8i5wxkbd7">This article</a> might help you choose. <strong>If you don't actively choose a license, you're effectively giving up all your rights to Medium.</strong></p>
<p>If you choose a license that allows people to share your work, it can get reposted elsewhere. This is great to expand the reach of our stories. E.g. <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/how-to-bootstrap-a-bossless-organization-in-3-easy-steps">Shareable</a> and <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/how-to-bootstrap-a-bossless-organization-in-3-easy-steps/2016/06/12">P2P Foundation</a> both reposted Rich’s Bossless Organisations piece.</p>
<p>If you want to make it easier on the editors of those publications, it’s helpful to publish a raw Markdown or Html version of your post somewhere. For example, see how Rich did that at the very end of <a href="https://medium.com/@richdecibels/occupiers-from-tunisia-spain-new-zealand-taiwan-and-france-compare-notes-5c6cc6d3afd3#.5ufyt410n">this post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-the-original-experiment"><a class="header" href="#impact-on-the-original-experiment">Impact on the original experiment</a></h2>
<p>The results have been great: about 40 people have written stories, growing the publication to 2800 followers, getting about 5-10k hits in a month. Here's a summary of our all-time views:</p>

<h2 id="aka-restorative-justice-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#aka-restorative-justice-guidelines">a.k.a. Restorative Justice Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>Enspiral's value resides in the people and the relationships that make up our inspiring, changemaking network. We collectively strive to foster an increasingly open, inclusive and caring culture. The <a href="guides/../archive/well-working-group.html">Well Working Group</a> historically supported this mission by developing network resources for constructive dialogue and co-working.</p>
<p>In this document you will find three suggested steps to take to safely and appropriately resolve conflict. Also included are support mechanisms if you need additional input to help resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Note: If you currently feel unsafe in Enspiral's communication channels, please immediately e-mail the board at <a href="mailto:foundation@enspiral.com">foundation@enspiral.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, seek local law enforcement.</strong></p>
<p>We ask all Enspiral participants to recognize these network safety guidelines for resolving serious conflicts.</p>
<p>If you are in conflict with someone else consider taking these three steps:</p>
<h3 id="1--contemplate-conflict"><a class="header" href="#1--contemplate-conflict">1.  Contemplate Conflict</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Take time to process your experiences if you feel confused, overwhelmed or agitated.</li>
<li>Note uncertainties and possible misunderstandings in your interactions, including cultural differences.</li>
<li>Distinguish people's actions from your feelings about them. They're both important, but they're different.</li>
<li>Distinguish disagreement from personal hostility. We're allowed to disagree, dissent and discuss.</li>
<li>Review relevant documents and Conflict Resolution Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've contemplated the experience and have decided it feels like it may be <em>harassment</em> or <em>abuse</em>, please consult our <a href="guides/../agreements/harassment_and_abuse.html">Harassment and Abuse Policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2--invite-conversation"><a class="header" href="#2--invite-conversation">2.  Invite Conversation</a></h3>
<p>If you're unable to resolve a conflict on your own, invite conversation. The sooner the better.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you feel able and safe to, directly discuss your concerns with the person you are in conflict with.</li>
<li>Otherwise, see Conflict Resolution Support.</li>
<li>Consider your communication approach; <a href="guides/../guides/comms_guidelines.html">Comms Guidelines</a> might be helpful.</li>
<li>Ensure a mutually agreeable time and place for conversation, including adequate privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3--develop-a-plan"><a class="header" href="#3--develop-a-plan">3.  Develop a Plan</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Foster inclusive dialogue by <em>sharing</em> ideas, <em>asking</em> clarifying questions, and <em>responding</em> to others' ideas.
<ul>
<li>Identify personal <em>wants</em> and <em>needs</em>.</li>
<li>Make <em>offers</em> or <em>requests</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In complex conflicts, develop <em>points of agreement</em> to facilitate progress.</li>
<li>Propose <em>plans</em> to treat conflict in a mutually satisfactory way.</li>
<li>Mutually <em>sign written plans</em> in serious cases, or whenever desired.</li>
<li><em>Follow up</em> later to discuss progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conflict-resolution-support"><a class="header" href="#conflict-resolution-support">Conflict Resolution Support</a></h2>
<p>Again, if you've contemplated the experience and have decided it feels like it may be <em>harassment</em> or <em>abuse</em>, please consult our <a href="guides/../agreements/harassment_and_abuse.html">Harassment and Abuse Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these support stages may be pursued separately or together.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-when-to-enlist-more-support"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-know-when-to-enlist-more-support">How do I know when to enlist more support?</a></h3>
<p>The time to escalate is when you've been trying to work at one level and you reach an impasse, both parties unable to compromise in any way.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a 1-1 meeting with reasonable, clear asks which become unmet requests, it would be at this point you might consider bringing a third party in to mediate.</p>
<p>There are four steps you might consider to reach a resolution, each step includes more people. The point is to resolve the conflict with as few people involved as possible.</p>
<h3 id="1-direct-communication"><a class="header" href="#1-direct-communication">1. Direct communication</a></h3>
<p>Directly discuss your concerns with a conflicting person <em>if you're comfortable doing that.</em></p>
<h3 id="2-private-support"><a class="header" href="#2-private-support">2. Private support</a></h3>
<p>Talk privately to your trusted friends to help you resolve conflicts with other Enspiral participants. Make a plan together about what you're going to do.</p>
<h3 id="3-expanded-dialogue"><a class="header" href="#3-expanded-dialogue">3. Expanded dialogue</a></h3>
<p>Enspiral participants may seek to informally resolve their conflicts by discussing them with mutually trusted Enspiral participants. This may be done either confidentially or openly.</p>
<h3 id="4-mediation"><a class="header" href="#4-mediation">4. Mediation</a></h3>
<p>For intense conflicts, Enspiral participants may request mediation meetings which are assigned to trained, in-network (or external) mediators.</p>
<p>Our expectations are that a mediator is suitably qualified, costs incurred will be negotiated directly with the people involved. We commit to hosting a recurring bucket and—at the Enspiral Foundation's discretion—the use of reserves.</p>

<h2 id="comms-guidelines-1"><a class="header" href="#comms-guidelines-1">Comms Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>This guide is here to give an overview of the channels we've decided to adopt and to give you some tips for how best to communicate with the network.</p>
<p>These comms channels are hosted by the Enspiral Foundation and are open to all contributors (or wider). If you are a contributor but lack access to something, contact foundation@enspiral.com</p>
<h2 id="comms-platforms-and-tools"><a class="header" href="#comms-platforms-and-tools">Comms Platforms and Tools</a></h2>
<h3 id="loomio---group-decisions"><a class="header" href="#loomio---group-decisions"><a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/1xCPyY46/enspiral"><strong>Loomio</strong></a> <strong>- Group Decisions</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our tool for decision making and thoughtful discussions. By default, assume the whole network will see everything.</p>
<p>Posting on Loomio in the main Enspiral group won't necessarily <em>alert</em> everyone, but if you invite the whole group to a thread or to vote on a poll, Loomio will notify everyone (sending emails to any of our 200 people around the world, if they haven't changed their settings,) and so should be used judiciously. Big announcements can make a lot of noise if we overuse them.</p>
<p>Feel free to start subgroups on Loomio if you'd like a more targeted collaboration space with a subset of Enspiral people.</p>
<h3 id="enspiral-insider---internal-newsletter"><a class="header" href="#enspiral-insider---internal-newsletter"><strong>Enspiral Insider</strong> - <strong>Internal Newsletter</strong></a></h3>
<p>Every month, an internal newsletter goes out to all Enspiral contributors via private Substack. It compiles updates from the network, requests, offers, and showcases content created by Enspiral members, and other content that our members found valuable to share.</p>
<p>To get something included in the newsletter post on Slack (#enspiral-news is a good place, but we scan most popular channels, for example #watercooler). If you want to reach the whole network with non-urgent infomation, this is the way.</p>
<p>When you join Enspiral you should be added to the newsletter. If for some reason you are not receiving our internal newsletter, contact foundation@enspiral.com and we'll fix it for you 💜</p>
<p>We also have an <a href="https://enspiral.substack.com">external newsletter</a>. There's no need to subscribe to both - internal newsletter has more info + links to our internal affairs.</p>
<h3 id="enspiral-chat---daily-realtime-comms"><a class="header" href="#enspiral-chat---daily-realtime-comms"><a href="https://chat.enspiral.com/"><strong>Enspiral Chat</strong></a> <strong>- Daily Realtime Comms</strong></a></h3>
<p>Daily chatting, realtime comms, quick questions, interesting links. There is a ~town-spiral channel for general discussion, and many channels for teams, projects, locations, and topics, or you can create your own!</p>
<p>{% hint style="info" %}</p>
<p>If you'd have to pick ONE channel to join, it's definitely ~town-spiral.</p>
<p>{% endhint %}</p>
<p>Enspiral Chat runs on the Mattermost open source platform. Here's an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16svrL5uOtyxauR-8VfRqHL0OW_st4ch80RW4gP1jRVM/edit">Onboarding Guide</a> to help you join the chat.</p>
<p>You can browse through, and join, all the channels by clicking the + button at the top left. Note that some channels are inactive.</p>
<p>Here's a list of popular Enspiral Chat Channels:</p>
<h4 id="locations"><a class="header" href="#locations">Locations</a></h4>
<p>(particularly relevant if you're based around a specific place.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Europe</li>
<li>Wellington</li>

<li>Enspiral-News - A channel to add in any links or news you would like to have shared in the next issue of Enspiral news. If there is important or useful context you would like included, please drop that in as well</li>
<li>Enstagram - Like Enspiral-Instragam: a place we can share snapshots from daily life so it feels like we are hanging out together even when we’re all over the world!</li>
<li>Thanks - expressing gratitude</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="cobudget---collaborative-funding"><a class="header" href="#cobudget---collaborative-funding"><a href="https://cobudget.com"><strong>Cobudget</strong></a> <strong>- Collaborative Funding</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our tool for budgeting and financial decision making. Enspiral's discretionary budget is distributed using a democratic process. All contributors are welcome to raise buckets (funding requests) and comment on buckets. If your message is about spending collective money, it probably makes sense to post it here as a bucket or comment.</p>
<h3 id="google-workspace"><a class="header" href="#google-workspace"><strong>Google Workspace</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Email - Everyone at Enspiral can pay a subscription fee to have an Enspiral email address if they need one to represent Enspiral to clients or the public. Email is great for one-on-one or small group correspondence, or one-way announcements. Here's the<a href="guides/../agreements/email_accounts_agreement.html"> email accounts agreement</a>.</li>
<li>Calendar - Great for your own planning and for private events and meetings where you have a specific guest list in mind.</li>
<li>Drive - We use Drive (Docs, Sheets, Forms) extensively. If a team you're working with uses Drive, you'll be invited to the relevant folders/docs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="facebook---casual-asynchronous-comms"><a class="header" href="#facebook---casual-asynchronous-comms"><strong>Facebook - Casual Asynchronous Comms</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Public <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Enspiral">Facebook page</a> - Updates, news, and links relevant to Enspiral followers. This is a one-to-many channel. To get something posted here, contact news@enspiral.com.</li>
<li>Private <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/enspiral">Facebook group</a> - A space for Enspiral contributors to share links, updates, ideas, and discussion. This is a many-to-many channel, where everyone can post and reply.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blog--content"><a class="header" href="#blog--content"><a href="guides/"><strong>Blog &amp; Content</strong></a></a></h3>
<p>Enspiral has a publication on Medium called <a href="http://medium.com/enspiral-tales">Enspiral Tales</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/enspiral">youtube channel</a>. We welcome content from anyone in the network. <a href="guides/../guides/blogging.html">Find out more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="comms-tips-and-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#comms-tips-and-guidelines">Comms Tips and Guidelines</a></h2>
<p>We operate in an attention economy. Getting the attention of people at Enspiral is expensive! Here's some advice about making it count.</p>
<p><strong>This is YOUR Space</strong></p>
<p>We are all greatly enriched by all of our engagement. Your voice is welcome. Your perspective is valued. Your interests are interesting. The best thing you can do to give and receive value is <em>participate</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Pick your Channel Wisely</strong></p>
<p>Know the various channels available and consciously decide where to post. Within a given tool, post to the right group or channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics requiring a group decision and affecting everyone go on Loomio</li>
<li>Issues, improvements and general discussion go on Github</li>
<li>Broadcast announcements to all contributors go in News</li>
<li>Casual realtime communication goes on Slack. You will reach whoever opts in to read when you happen to post.</li>
<li>Other casual communication goes in the Facebook group - again you'll reach whoever opts in there.</li>
<li>Public info and links go on Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>Long form public sharing goes on Enspiral Tales</li>
</ul>
<p>Messages relevant only to a limited group of people should be emailed directly, or posted in a specific Slack channel or Loomio subgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Subject Lines</strong></p>
<p>Put all the relevant info you can very concisely in the subject line (or discussion title on Loomio). Messages on Loomio trigger an email hundreds of people, many of whom will look no further than the subject line. Who, what, where, why, when.</p>
<p><strong>Key Details in the First Message</strong></p>
<p>Put all the relevant details in the body of the message, Chalkle event description, calendar invite, etc. You often only have one shot to reach people. Most will never click through to look at followup comments. Make sure the key info is in the initial post.</p>
<p><strong>Include Links, Make it Easy</strong></p>
<p>If you want people to click through to other content, include links! People will not go searching for facebook events, google docs, etc, on their own. Put everything they need right in front of people.</p>
<p><strong>Tag Specific People</strong></p>
<p>If a post is relevant to specific people, tag them (on Slack, Loomio, Facebook) to help them notice it's there. People will often respond directly to stuff they are tagged in, which can increase engagement. Don’t post a comment that is just tagging a name though - that means the person will get an email notification that simply says their name. You want them to get a message too.</p>
<p><strong>Be Very Sparing with @Channel tags</strong></p>
<p>In Slack, @channel or @everyone notifications will send notifications to everyone in that channel - please use this sparingly for very important or time sensitive information, especially in large channels. Don't use @channel in #watercooler unless it's something that literally affects everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Get Permissions Right</strong></p>
<p>If you’re linking to something on Google Drive (or any other site), make sure you check the sharing settings before you hit send! It’s very common to be given a link only to be told “you don’t have permission” when you try to view it. Most people won’t come back and try again, so get it right the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Include</strong> <em><strong>All</strong></em> <strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Write every message as if to someone who has never heard of it before, especially network-wide messages. Don’t assume people already know any context, since your audience has diverse levels of engagement. We want invitations to engagement to be as accessible as possible. Be aware of Enspiral jargon and assumptions. Include links to relevant background info or previous discussions so people can catch themselves up.</p>
<p><strong>Make it Count</strong></p>
<p>Send out as few messages as possible, and use each one to the max. Consider how precious people’s time is. Our attention is a commons we share - if we start overusing it, we'll degrade it for everyone. Do a quick search to see if there’s already an existing thread on the topic before posting a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Ask for Help</strong></p>
<p>Realize that any time you’re communicating to large groups of people, you are doing comms work. If you’re not sure, or not very experienced with comms work, just check in with someone who can help you think through your message and how you’re delivering it to make sure it’s maximally effective.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it brief</strong></p>
<p>‘nough said!</p>

<h2 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></h2>
<p>This Handbook is like a wiki, maintained by everyone in the community: we need your help! Enspiral Contributors: join the #handbook channel on Slack and we can support you to get started.</p>
<h2 id="the-github-method"><a class="header" href="#the-github-method">The Github Method</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Github</a> is a platform that is mostly used by developers to manage software projects: it allows many contributors to all work on a single project without stepping on each other's toes. It has a system for storing files and proposing changes to them in a managed way. (This is based on an amazing free technology called git.)</p>
<p>All the files that make up this handbook live in a Github "repository" (often called a "repo") : <a href="https://github.com/enspiral/handbook">https://github.com/enspiral/handbook</a></p>
<p><strong>Check the</strong> <a href="guides/../guides/github_for_beginners.html"><strong>Github for Beginners</strong></a> <strong>guide if you want to learn more.</strong></p>
<p>If you have a Github account, you can draft another version of the handbook and let people comment on your draft. You make a "pull request" to request that repo maintainers merge your changes into the canonical version of the handbook, the "master" version. If you don't have an account <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">click here</a> to set one up. Once you have an account, post your github user ID in the #enspiral_help channel in Slack and ask for someone to add you to Enspiral' github account.</p>
<p>To change an agreement you need to follow the process outlined in the <a href="guides/../agreements/decisions.html">decisions agreement</a>. These agreements govern our community so they can only be changed with community input.</p>
<p>If you're making a small edit like fixing a typo, or adding a guide, the pull request is a good place to start.</p>
<h3 id="heres-how-to-propose-a-change"><a class="header" href="#heres-how-to-propose-a-change">Here's how to propose a change:</a></h3>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVvda3ci4w4">the quick demo video</a>, or read on:</p>
<h4 id="step-1"><a class="header" href="#step-1">Step 1</a></h4>
<p>First, go to the <a href="https://github.com/enspiral/handbook">enspiral/handbook</a> Github repo (you'll need to be a logged Github user). Click "Fork" to make your own copy of the repo. It'll ask for a destination: just select your personal account.</p>
<p><img src="guides/../.gitbook/assets/contributing-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="step-2"><a class="header" href="#step-2">Step 2</a></h4>
<p>Now you're on your own version of the handbook. You can add files with "Create new file" or "Upload files". To edit an existing file, select it from the list, then click the little pencil icon near the top right.</p>
<p><img src="guides/../.gitbook/assets/contributing-2.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="step-3"><a class="header" href="#step-3">Step 3</a></h4>
<p>Now you're in a file editor, so you can make any changes you want. We're using <a href="http://loomio.org/markdown">markdown</a> to add formatting, links, images, etc. You can see how this markdown formatting will render by clicking "Preview changes". Text outlined in red is the stuff you're proposing to remove, and green means you're proposing an addition. Hit "Commit changes" to finish editing.</p>
<p><img src="guides/../.gitbook/assets/contributing-3.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="step-4"><a class="header" href="#step-4">Step 4</a></h4>
<p>Once you've added and edited all the files required to make a useful change to the handbook, go back to your repo (click <code>yourGithubUsername/handbook</code> at the top of the page) and click "New pull request".</p>
<p><img src="guides/../.gitbook/assets/contributing-4.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="step-5"><a class="header" href="#step-5">Step 5</a></h4>
<p>This will take you to the <code>enspiral/handbook</code> repo, and give you a preview of the whole set of changes you are proposing. If it looks right, then click "Create pull request" and fill in a title and details for the pull request, so people know at a glance what is included. Finally, you need to click "Create pull request" once more, which will make your proposal final and notify the repo maintainers that you want to make a change.</p>
<p><img src="guides/../.gitbook/assets/contributing-5.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="handbook-maintainers"><a class="header" href="#handbook-maintainers">Handbook Maintainers</a></h2>
<p>Handbook maintainers aim to merge pull requests within 1-2 days. As a general guideline a maintainer does not merge in their own branches or pull requests. If they cannot get hold of another maintainer they may merge their own branches.</p>
<p>To improve communications and understanding, its useful for your proposed changes to reference an <a href="https://github.com/enspiral/improvements/issues">underlying issue</a> that your changes aim to solve.</p>
<p>If you want to become a maintainer ask @joshuavial to give to maintainer rights.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="content-dusting"><a class="header" href="#content-dusting">Content dusting</a></h1>
<p>Enspiral members and contributors create a lot of content. On Github, Google Docs and more.</p>
<p>In order to keep what we write up-to-date and consistent, we practice « content dusting ». That is, we keep an eye on the actual content we create through Github and Google Drive to identify the parts that become stale or lose relevance, and suggest amendments where appropriate.</p>
<p>Note: This process description focuses on Github and Google Drive dusting work right now. If you think similar work should be done on other platforms we use, feel free to edit/amend this document.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-with-dusting"><a class="header" href="#whats-in-with-dusting">What's in with dusting?</a></h2>
<p>This group exists as another means to provide easily accessible tasks to contributors who are having a hard time finding how to get involved at a practical level with Enspiral. Doing work that has positive impact for the network should not require specific knowledge about our governance practices or processes, and should also be workable for people who have low capacity or want low engagement.</p>
<p>Amending content and discussing with content authors are also means to directly connect to arguably the most important part of Enspiral - what gets done. By creating more direct collaboration dynamics, we envision that engagement in « working on stuff that matters » will naturally follow, and that durable cross-network connections will form between content dusting volunteers and content creators.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-content-dusting"><a class="header" href="#getting-started-with-content-dusting">Getting started with content dusting</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Find something stale</strong> - Find something in any of the Github repositories or Google Drive document that was authored a while ago and you think would be relevant to update. Github content dusting is mostly targeted towards the Handbook, but also other public facing content and software repositories. Google Drive has a lot of spreadsheets, legal paperwork, visuals and much more.</p>
<p>Let your skills and own perception of « stuff that matters » guide you towards the piece of stale content that you want to update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2 - Put yourself in the author's shoes</strong> - Before you even notify them that some of their previous work needs a rework, think of what you would do in their place to get things sorted. Make sure you understand what needs doing to an extent that will allow effective communication with the author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Notify the author and take steps towards resolution</strong> - It's now time to notify the author of the issue you've found. If the content is in a Github file, find the original commit where this content was authored <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/">using these instructions</a>, and place a Github comment on the relevant line. If it's on the Drive, just include a comment and mention the author and any other person you think should be notified. Your comment should ideally offer a simple solution to the issue and potentially request mandate to amend the author's work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Github tip: You can use the <code>- [ ] item</code> notation to create a checklist. This will allow you to list tasks that authors will be able give you mandate for by ticking the box. For trivial amendments that you think are not worth disturbing the author, go straigth to committing changes.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 4 - Publish the changes</strong> - Acting upon your words and any clarification the authors gave, amend the content (e.g. by editing the actual files instead of comments on a Google docs, and by and commit your work on Github).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Github tip: Depending on the repository, it may be useful to use the <code>git</code> tool to clone, create a new branch, commit, and then making a pull-request on Github. Reach out to the <a href="guides/content-dusting.html#content-dusting"><code>#content-dusting</code> Slack channel</a> for any assistance with this workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 5 - Follow through (but don't burn your wings)</strong> - Understand that the author may now be busy with other work, and may need to be reminded several times of the issue. We advice against insisting if authors state that the amendment should not be made. In that case limit the scope of your work to what is actually needed and received as help. Also be extra cautious of complex tasks that would get you stuck for too long. On these, limit <em>step 3</em> to simple notifications/discussions and reminders, not the actual implementation of a solution.</p>

<p>This guide covers instructions for Enspiral email's, account security, Google groups and Google Drive</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>To request or remove your account, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpzzBQOHtMCowHOLamaBYqu4a-TsoP7Z4T8R-3pUWveyD0sw/viewform#responses">this form</a>.

<h3 id="what-you-need-to-know"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-know">What you need to know</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An account allows you to have all the normal google services hosted within Enspiral's Google apps domain. eg. an Enspiral email address and aliases, google drive, google calendar and google groups. But an account isn't necessary to interact with Enspiral people or to use the various services and tools.</li>
<li>An account costs 108 NZD per year. This bill is separate to the annual contribution.</li>
<li>If you need an account to work for an Enspiral venture, that venture will organise it for you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="account-security"><a class="header" href="#account-security">Account security</a></h3>
<p>Ops HIGHLY recommends you keep your account as secure as possible. A few small tweaks will reduce the chance your identity is stolen. Here's some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a long password</strong>. Getting Chrome to remember it is better than nothing (we use 1password and lastpass).</li>
<li>Setup 2-step authentication. Seriously, it's not worth the risks of not doing it. Do Google's security check up <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">here</a>. Ideally do everything on that page but at the very least setup 2-step and some backup codes in case you get locked out. It'll only ask you for a code every 30 days either via text or the google authenticator app. Use the app if you'll be travelling overseas.</li>
<li>Next level security is to buy a Yubico key and use that instead of phone or google authenticator. It is more convenient (if you have keys with you) and is far more secure.</li>
<li>Make sure your software is up-to-date</li>
<li>School up on what phishing is and how to avoid it. There are some really great looking fake gmail login pages out there that will suck up your login details and you won't have a clue you've been hacked, until it's too late. <a href="https://www.tracesecurity.com/blog/social-engineering-red-flags">Read this</a></li>

<li>A group allows you to have a generic email address @enspiral without setting up another Google account.</li>
<li>A group can have many members and they can all control whether they receive the emails that are sent to the group.</li>
<li>If you want to forward the emails to a particular tool, you can add the tools generic email address as a member of the group. You could also adjust everyone's email settings so they don't receive the emails if it was only for email forwarding.</li>

<h3 id="using-groups-for-google-drive-permissions"><a class="header" href="#using-groups-for-google-drive-permissions">Using Groups for Google Drive permissions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you share a Google Drive folder with a group, everyone in that group will have access to the folder.</li>
<li>Once the folder is shared, you still need to send the link to the folder to everyone in the group.</li>
<li>Once each person clicks on the folder link, they need to click on the folder name drop down and select "Add to My Drive"</li>
<li>To remove the folder from their my drive, all they do is right click on it and select "Remove". This will take the folder out of the My Drive but not out of the original place it was created.</li>

<li>Every contributor is added to a Enspiral Contributor group which has access to some of the Enspiral folders.</li>
<li>Any file created in one of those folders inherits the permissions of the folder it's in.</li>
<li>You can change the permissions on any individual document you create.</li>
<li>PLEASE DO THIS: When you're sharing with anyone in Enspiral, please make sure the permissions are correct! "Anyone at Enspiral can find and edit" only allows people with Enspiral email accounts to edit the document. If you want to share it with everyone, ideally place it in an Enspiral folder which should inherit the correct permissions. To be sure, scroll through who the document has been shared with, it should include "Foundation Contributors" Google group. You don't need to individually add everyone if that group is there.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="enspiral-values"><a class="header" href="#enspiral-values">Enspiral Values</a></h1>
<p>Enspiral members are expected to walk the talk and live the values of Integrity, Purpose, Commitment, Generosity, Good Judgement, Leadership, Engagement and Collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
<p>Be trustworthy and to have a high level of personal integrity. Honesty and doing the right thing are just the starting point - true integrity means knowing who we are, what we value, and integrating that with our words and actions. We speak our truth even when it is unpopular, and we do not compromise on what is important.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>We fundamentally believe our role on this planet is one of service and contribution - we are here to build a better world. We are idealistic, and we are pragmatic. We are motivated by the heart, and we act with considered intelligence. We love fun and new ways to do things, and we can persevere through the hard times. We understand things worth doing aren’t always easy. We are here to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong></p>
<p>Enspiral is important to us. For some of us it is our life’s work, and for others it is our sole source of income. For all of us, it is a big part of our lives and way up our priority list of where we put our energy.</p>
<p><strong>Generosity</strong></p>
<p>We give freely of our time and money to help others. This doesn’t mean we will go broke giving what we don’t have, but our natural impulse is to share. We make sacrifices to help those around us, and actively look for opportunities to create and share abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Good Judgment</strong></p>
<p>When we offer someone membership we are giving them a binding vote in the most important decisions we face as a collective, so we better be sure their judgment is sound. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and experience, but on the whole we look for people who make good decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
<p>We don’t sit around and talk about what someone else should do to make things better - we act. We don’t always ask permission before starting something new, and we risk failure striving for difficult dreams. Everyone should lead some of the time, but no one should lead all the time. Leadership should be balanced with active followership.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong></p>
<p>In order for us to realise the benefits of distributed power and diverse viewpoints, we need to participate in decision making and discussion. People get busy or distracted at times, but overall engagement is important. This might mean jumping in online, attending meetings, going to retreats, recruiting and supporting new people, and participating in collaborative processes.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>We love autonomy and self-determination, but we can add more value working together than on our own. If someone in their hearts is a lone wolf and doesn’t think we can build something better by working together, then membership of this collective is not for them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="github-for-beginners"><a class="header" href="#github-for-beginners">Github for Beginners</a></h1>
<h2 id="why-git"><a class="header" href="#why-git">Why Git?</a></h2>
<p>We use Git because it is an amazing structured collaboration process that enables thousands of people to work on projects without central coordination. There is a learning curve but it is worth the effort.</p>
<p>Git is like a central collaboration trunk with a million services that work on top of it.</p>
<p>The first one we use is <strong>Github</strong>: it's a hosting service for Git repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Gitbooks</strong> is another service we use: it turns all the files you see on <a href="http://github.com/enspiral/handbook">github.com/enspiral/handbook</a> into the nice browsable, searchable, portable package you can see at <a href="http://handbook.enspiral.com">handbook.enspiral.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="git-lingo-issues-repos-pull-requests-and-merging"><a class="header" href="#git-lingo-issues-repos-pull-requests-and-merging">Git lingo: issues, repos, pull requests, and merging</a></h2>
<p><strong>Repo</strong> is short for <strong>repository</strong>: in Git, all the files for a project live in a repo.</p>
<p>A <strong>Github issue</strong> is a public discussion for work-in-progress.</p>
<p>So for instance, when I see something wrong with Loomio, I go to <a href="http://github.com/loomio/loomio/issues">the Loomio repo on Github</a> and say "I found a bug, this thing is broken!" Then we have a discussion about how to fix it. Sometime later someone can propose a fix, and reference the issue, so when the proposal is accepted, the issue gets closed.</p>
<p>In git lingo, the proposal is a <strong>pull request</strong> and it is accepted by <strong>merging</strong> in the changes.</p>

<h2 id="every-experience-of-enspiral-is-different"><a class="header" href="#every-experience-of-enspiral-is-different">Every experience of Enspiral is different</a></h2>
<p>Enspiral is a network of individuals, each with wonderfully varied experiences, aspirations, skills, knowledge, connections…and baggage! We all have our own versions of all of these, and it influences our experience of Enspiral just as much as it does the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps even more, because Enspiral is a space which imposes less clarity around what it is and does. So those personal patterns of desire, reaction and defence can have a greater influence over the experience you have.</p>
<p>This is not right or wrong. Not good or bad. It just is. And knowing it can help you let go of expectations (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#leave-your-expectations-at-the-door">Leave your expectations at the door</a>’), and be present to what your unique experience is.</p>
<h2 id="leave-your-expectations-at-the-door"><a class="header" href="#leave-your-expectations-at-the-door">Leave your expectations at the door</a></h2>
<p>The picture of Enspiral that is presented outside of the network can differ markedly from the experience you find when joining.</p>
<p>Some of this comes from materials and experiences generated in the early days of Enspiral that still live on within the ‘library of the internet’. Some of this is the result of the Enspiral experience varying considerably between individuals (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#every-experience-of-enspiral-is-different">Every experience of Enspiral is different</a>’). Some of this is because of the attachment people have to what Enspiral represents to them rather than what it really is.</p>
<p>Enspiral is still a network of ‘people doing good in the world’. But your experience will be more accurate (and likely less frustrating) if you let go of every other expectation and assumption you have. Join because you think this might be a place where you fit, not because you need Enspiral to do, be or deliver something specific.</p>
<h2 id="enspiral-is-purpose-agnostic"><a class="header" href="#enspiral-is-purpose-agnostic">Enspiral is ‘purpose-agnostic’</a></h2>
<p>To become part of the Enspiral network, it does not matter what version of ‘doing good in the world’ you embrace. Or whether this is an aspiration, something you’re actively involved in or something you’ve done in the past. </p>
<p>For example, you may be focused on eliminating poverty across many regions of the world and spend hundreds of hours each year flying from place to place. Alternatively, you may be at the frontline of local initiatives to minimise carbon emissions. Both are welcome.</p>
<p>Similarly, an Enspiral retreat may embrace one set of values (vegetarian meals) and ignore another (minimising carbon footprint).</p>
<p>This can be a little confusing and confounding for the newcomer who is viewing things through their own specific ‘purpose lens’.</p>
<p>But how do you know whether your definition of ‘doing good in the world’ is accepted? Well, at least one person within the network will need to agree with you for an invitation to be offered in the first place. And if you’re pushing the boundaries of what might be considered as ‘doing good’ they’ll likely sense-check with others in the network too. </p>
<p>So whilst Enspiral is ‘purpose-agnostic’, there will be boundaries, and those boundaries have not been defined. The work of doing so will likely happen only as the need arises, which can be seen as either efficient prioritisation of capacity or perpetuating a lack of clarity. Or anything in between.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that any decision around boundaries may or may not happen within a defined and agreed framework (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#decisions-happen-through-due-process">Decisions happen through due process</a>’). </p>
<p>If you think you’re pushing the boundaries, the best course of action is to ask. If nothing else, you’ll be creating the opportunity for Enspiral to engage and evolve.</p>

<p>At least sometimes they do...</p>
<p>Enspiral is a network of individuals, each with their own unique relationship to…   …well, everything! </p>
<p>Over the years, Enspiral has experimented with numerous formal methodologies for decision- and agreement-making, and many are still in use today. Some are more effective than others. Some are more clearly defined than others. Some are more enjoyable than others. </p>
<p>The experience of these processes is as individual as those who are involved in them. </p>
<p>However, many decisions and agreements are made outside of these formal processes, whether during in-person get-togethers like Summerfest or on asynchronous communication channels like Slack. And depending on where, when and how deeply you’re engaged with the network, you may not realise it’s happening, or have an opportunity to participate.</p>
<p>This is how it is.</p>
<p>Some decisions or agreements have a defined process (e.g. co-budget funding rounds). For others, whether a formal process is justified or required – and the extent to which the Enspiral network is consulted or invited to participate – is generally determined by those involved. If the decision is significant, at least some will likely be individuals with deeper experience of Enspiral, and the network relies on their judgement to strike an appropriate balance between action, participation and risk.</p>
<h2 id="openness-and-connection-does-not-mean-friendship"><a class="header" href="#openness-and-connection-does-not-mean-friendship">Openness and connection does not mean friendship</a></h2>
<p>The openness with which new people are welcomed into the network (particularly at Enspiral events) along with the authenticity with which people share, is a key element in the Enspiral experience. But for many newcomers this can feel like people are becoming your friend…   …because that’s the main situation in which you might have experienced such openness in the past.</p>
<p>Don’t mistake this openness and acceptance for friendship. That’s not to say people you meet within Enspiral can’t become friends, as some most likely will.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful aspect of Enspiral, but can also be confusing for newcomers. People who might connect with each other only once, or maybe once every year or so, are typically able to be present and receive fully. They can be there for each other, and for you, in the moment.</p>
<p>Over time (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#give-it-time">Give it time</a>’), those connections you repeat will likely build and strengthen. Though the timescale can be much longer than you’re used to, the result can be a network of like-minded people you can reach out to for help, to discuss a particular topic or just a periodic chat.</p>
<p>Be curious, don’t assume friendship or familiarity, and stay connected where the exchanges are mutually beneficial. The rest will take care of itself.</p>
<h2 id="participate-at-a-level-that-is-appropriate-for-you"><a class="header" href="#participate-at-a-level-that-is-appropriate-for-you">Participate at a level that is appropriate for you</a></h2>
<p>By participating in Enspiral events, processes, working groups and so on, you will gain experience, acknowledgement, connections and opportunities. Over time you will also gain social capital (whether you want it or not…).</p>
<p>On arrival into the network this is an exciting opportunity, and many leap in with both feet, particularly if this is the first space in which they’ve connected with like-minded people.</p>
<p>But many also become disillusioned, frustrated and burnt out within the first 6-12 months. The enthusiasm to engage can turn to disappointment with the lack of progress, not being heard or the sheer level of energy required to remain engaged at a high level.</p>
<p>Pace yourself (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#give-it-time">Give it time</a>’ below), and find a level of engagement that is appropriate, healthy and sustainable for you. Above all, don’t judge yourself against others.</p>
<p>Everyone’s situation is different. Everyone’s ability to contribute is different. Everyone’s tolerance for process is different. Everyone’s influence on outcomes is different.</p>
<p>Embrace your unique differences and be you. It’s the greatest contribution you can make.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-in-social-capital"><a class="header" href="#the-power-in-social-capital">The power in social capital</a></h2>
<p>With the removal of the member / contributor divide in mid-2022, Enspiral is now broadly non-hierarchical in terms of decision-making structures. Anyone within the network can engage in processes that determine the future direction of Enspiral, how it operates, how its funds are spent, suggest amendments to agreements, and so on (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#decisions-happen-through-due-process">Decisions happen through due process</a>’).</p>
<p>However, not all opinions and perspectives have equal weight within these processes.</p>
<p>Whilst there is no hierarchical power, there is considerable social capital held by specific individuals, whether wanted or not. Examples include those who’ve been in Enspiral a long time (particularly early founding members), those who arrive with established reputations for high impact work, and those who have put a lot of time and energy into participating in Enspiral events, processes, working groups, etc.</p>
<p>All people are not equal within Enspiral, and it pays to acknowledge this at the outset.</p>
<h2 id="your-full-self-may-not-yet-be-received"><a class="header" href="#your-full-self-may-not-yet-be-received">Your full self may not (yet) be received</a></h2>
<p>Whilst there is a wide acceptance of an individual’s ‘purpose’ within Enspiral (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#enspiral-is-purpose-agnostic">Enspiral is ‘purpose agnostic</a>’), there are certain aspects of diversity that are not comfortably held. As a network of individuals, Enspiral still learning, still evolving, and the first step in that is to acknowledge where we fall short.</p>
<p>Issues that society as a whole may still be grappling with such as gender and race are broadly embraced and openly discussed. Yet depending on the context, other aspects of how people live their lives  – such as our relationships to fossil fuels, agro-chemicals, firearms – may not feel as safe to share. We know we can do better.</p>
<p>It is up to all of us to work to accept others as they are, and be kind to everyone (including ourselves) when we cannot. We all have work to do in this area – perhaps the most important thing is not where we are, but that we’re actively doing the work to grow.</p>
<h2 id="give-it-time"><a class="header" href="#give-it-time">Give it time</a></h2>
<p>It takes time to work out what your version of the Enspiral experience is. It takes time to understand the processes that shape and steer this network. It takes time for initial connections to become people you can reach out to. It takes time to find your place and build your presence.</p>
<p>Many newcomers to Enspiral leave within the first 12-18 months, and for any number of reasons. So make sure you give it – and yourself – time. Time for the true shape of Enspiral to emerge. And time for you to truly see it, experience it and maybe even evolve yourself along the way.</p>
<p>The Enspiral network has had a huge positive influence on many, many people since its inception and continues to do so. It’s not for everyone, and it’s not always a long-term relationship. But you are more likely to find your best Enspiral experience if you give it time, and take an approach which means it’s sustainable to do so (see also ‘<a href="guides/newcomers.html#participate-at-a-level-that-is-appropriate-for-you">Participate at a level that is appropriate for you</a>’).</p>

<p>Activation Programme was an experiment launched in 2017 aimed to support new contributors to become quickly active in the community through a "learning by doing" process. It consists in completing a list of easy / intermediate / hard challenges that will help any new contributor know more about Enspiral processes, people and culture.</p>

<p>Optimi are contracted by the Enspiral Foundation to manage the global membership. When a new member is added by a Node, Optimi will add them to our loomio, slack, google drive and mailing list. If the Node is not financially enabled Optimi will also manage the financial subscriptions to the Foundation.</p>
<p>If a Node wishes for Optimi to do any custom integrations or management they will need to enter into an independent arrangement.</p>
<ul>

<ol>
<li>Node reps complete the “Add new contributor form” listed on the <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/eUqFhOdN/introductions-and-readme-2019">Forms page</a> in Loomio. Members are the new Contributor’s Steward by default unless they have arranged for someone else to be their Steward.</li>
<li>Upon completion of this Form, Ops receives a notification with all of the details.</li>
<li>At the same time, the new member is sent an automated email with a link and request to login to the directory.</li>
<li>Once they’ve set their password and logged in, they can fill out their bio including the following fields: personal tagline/origin story, website, ask me about, skills, activities, values, interests, bio/introduction, aspirations within the network</li>
<li>Once filled in, Ops invites them to Slack and Loomio for introductions as well as these other tools:
<ul>
<li>Cobudget</li>
<li>Added to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/enspiral.com/g/contributors">Foundation Global members</a> (to access Google Drive, this has to be a Google account)</li>
<li>Newsletter list (managed by the newsletter person).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Introductions are added to each tool as they accept their invites (which can take a while). Be sure to look our for those emails. Introductions are done on these channels:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.loomio.com/d/jysfbc2Q/introductions-and-readme">Loomio Introductions and Readme</a> - Manual intro by Ops</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>At this point the member is considered “Onboarded”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="offboarding"><a class="header" href="#offboarding">Offboarding</a></h3>
<p>Contributors are offboarded from the network when:</p>
<ul>
<li>they cancel their subscription</li>
<li>their payment method fails 3 times (they're still given some time to get in touch and can ask to be added back in, in the future)</li>
<li>they click on the “Opt out request” button in the directory app under My details</li>
</ul>
<p>Ops then removes the member from the following systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio</li>
<li>Cobudget (any remaining funds are recycled into the next Cobudget round)</li>
<li>Removed from the Foundation Global Members Group</li>
<li>Removed from the Monthly Enspiral Newsletter e-mail list (by newsletter person)</li>
<li>Slack: (Note: you cannot fully “remove” users, instead the members account is “disabled”)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the member has a Google Workspace account (a "name @ enspiral.com" account), they are notified via email and Slack that their Google Workspace account will be removed in two weeks. Ops schedules the account removal date. After two weeks, the account is removed and any remaining Google Drive documents owned by the contributor and shared with others are re-assigned to a nominated account managed by Ops.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pods"><a class="header" href="#pods">Pods</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-pod"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-pod">What is a pod?</a></h2>
<p>Pods are small groups of people (4 to 5 is suggested) formed by members and contributors of Enspiral. These groups can support us to build relationships across the network – especially with those further from the center – supporting more people to be ‘seen’ and to experience mutual support and care.</p>
<h2 id="forming-a-pod"><a class="header" href="#forming-a-pod">Forming a pod</a></h2>
<p>A pod is formed by a few people coming together around an <em>intention</em> and some <em>principles</em>. An initial invitation is made by a <em>caller,</em> who also coordinates the first video call or meeting.</p>
<p>The invitation will often come with the seed of an <em>intention</em>. It could also suggest a <em>format</em> that the group may choose to follow, or some <em>principles</em> and <em>rituals</em> to use through their calls.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>intention</strong> clearly states the common intent bringing a group together (e.g. studying a topic together or going through a self-development methodology).</li>
<li><strong>Principles</strong> are the set of rules, protocols and values that define the culture of the pod. You might consider principles around context, meeting rhythm as well as facilitation and hosting duties.</li>
<li><strong>Rituals</strong> are practices that help boost the interactivity of your calls. It could be as simple as holding a minute of silence at the start of the call.</li>
<li>A <strong>format</strong> gives your pod a direction and structure over time. It might specify a set of rituals for each session (of a set) or perhaps even activities that participants do in-between calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can refer to the <a href="guides/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/guides/pods.html#list-of-rituals">List of Rituals</a> and the <a href="guides/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/guides/pods.html#list-of-formats">List of Formats</a> for inspiration on what to propose to your group. The next section highlights key <em>principles</em> intended to increase the resilience of your pod and the broader set of pods across Enspiral… we're in this to grow (and compost) together!</p>
<h2 id="running-a-pod"><a class="header" href="#running-a-pod">Running a pod</a></h2>
<p>There are key areas where <em>principles</em> might be specifically important for all groups:</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Boundaries</strong> – What are you up for? And what are you not up for? Talk about your Norms and Boundaries. Eg, being respectful with each other, setting a confidentiality agreement, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Cadence</strong> - How often are you meeting? …for how long? Some pods do it every week for a while and then change to longer cadence, fortnightly or monthly. Many meet from either an hour up to an hour and a half. It is up to your pod members to decide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Having a regular time (eg, first Monday of the month) makes it significantly easier to get together. If you don't have a regular time to meet, dedicating a few minutes at the end of each meeting to schedule the next one makes logistics easier and more effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Presence</strong> - Agree on the minimum number of participants you want to be present to go ahead with a meeting: Do you want everyone to be present every time? Can you go ahead with a meeting if someone can’t make it?</p>
<p><strong>Cycles</strong> - When do you stop? When do you reflect? Start with the end in mind or with a moment when you will stop and reflect (also see <a href="guides/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/guides/pods.html#continuous-improvement"><em>Retrospective</em></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Hosting Duties</strong> - Should facilitation ‘rotate’ amongst your pod’s members, with a different person attending to the clock, agenda, or people’s speaking time each session? Should you take turns to decide who's in charge of inviting people of the next meeting and providing a link for them to join?</p>
<p><strong>Setup Concerns</strong> - Some pods may want to commit to certain basics, such as being able to see one another’s faces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Starting a slack channel or Loomio group (especially if not everyone is in Enspiral’s Slack) will help everyone know where to find key info and updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Naming Your Elders</strong> - What’s the lineage that you are following? Who are you emulating or modelling after?</p>
<h2 id="continuous-improvement"><a class="header" href="#continuous-improvement">Continuous improvement</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways you can help make your pod experience increasingly useful to its members and others:</p>
<p><strong>Retrospective</strong> - Agree on a time to stop and reflect on how is the pod working for each member: What is working well? What can be better? What are we going to change? You can use that reflection point as a good place to decide if you stop or if you keep on going, and how.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ For an easy 'how to,' go to the Retro section <a href="guides/web/enspiral-handbook-2023/guides/pods.html#list-of-rituals">under “Rituals”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sharing learnings</strong> - Share what you learn in your Retro with the network so we can all learn together. We will have shared learning prompts with the network every 3 months, and an open thread where everyone can post what have they learned from specific Formats and Rituals.</p>
<h2 id="the-pods-process-at-enspiral"><a class="header" href="#the-pods-process-at-enspiral">The pods process at Enspiral</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Every 4-6 months the pods working group will put a callout to the network for new pods formation.</li>
<li>People interested in being Callers or joining a new pod will opt-in, share what they're interested in, and find their pod members in compatible timezones.</li>
<li>Pods will form around the Intention, Principles and Format they choose, based on what the people in them agree on.</li>
<li>In advance of the next round, the pod working group will start a thread to encourage pods to do Retrospectives and collect and share lessons for the whole network.</li>
<li>Once a pod ends we will encourage people exiting a pod to either join another pod or become caller for new ones.</li>

<li>a. You can ask things like, ‘what would be wildly ideal’ and ‘what would spoil this for you’... exploring the extremes of what would be good for each individual can help you create healthy boundaries and expectations for the group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What recurring meeting time could work for us?

<li>a. having a concrete cadence, not having to find a time again and again, has a big impact on your group’s chances!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are folks ready to commit to?
<ul>
<li>a. This is the culminating question of the previous two explorations, and also gives people a concrete sense of ownership and dedication to the plan you laid out</li>
<li>b. It’s helpful if the commitment question includes a proposal of a duration—at the end of which you’ll have a retrospective or group reflection—in addition to the intention and cadence</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Project Kitchen methodology was developed by Seb Paquet and is an energising process for efficiently giving mutual support to projects through enabling group intelligence. We've also found this invaluable for cross-pollinating between different initiatives in the network. It can be done in-person or online using Google Hangouts or similar platform.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="project-kitchen-background"><a class="header" href="#project-kitchen-background">Project Kitchen background</a></h2>
<p>Project Kitchens are a socially curated, facilitated, and efficient way of moving projects forward.</p>
<p>The format brings together a small number of people who have projects they would like assistance with and puts one project at a time under the spotlight for around 25 minutes. Generally 3-4 projects can be covered in a 2-hour Kitchen. A Chef facilitates; with the role of creating an atmosphere of trust, keeping things rolling, and avoiding wasting time through the process.</p>
<p>The Project Kitchen method gives participants concrete ideas and encouragement for moving forward in their projects or ventures, a better idea of other participants’ contexts and needs, and generates a stronger sense of togetherness. As a bonus, it sharpens listening skills and ability to ask for help. It feels fun and is time-efficient.</p>
<h2 id="project-kitchen-process"><a class="header" href="#project-kitchen-process">Project Kitchen process</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check-ins</strong> - Each person in the group is invited to respond to the question 'How are you and why have you come today?' This gets everyone present.</li>
<li><strong>Overview of Project Kitchen</strong> - The Chef describes the Project Kitchen - how it developed, what it's designed to do, and a high level view of how it's going to roll.</li>
<li><strong>Notes document</strong> - We create a Google Doc, share with participants and 2-3 people offer to write up notes for the session. These notes are often hugely valuable to distribute further than the group who attends the Project Kitchen as they have concise information about what different people are working on and what they would like help with.</li>
<li><strong>Who has projects?</strong> Ask the group who has projects they would like help with. Four is ideal for a 2-hour session. If you have more projects than this then the group can make a decision of what projects to prioritise. Once you've decided what projects to engage in, the Project Kitchen choreography can begin with the first project.</li>
<li><strong>Choreography</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context :</strong> Project holder talks about their project - giving the context the group needs to understand what they're working on and what burning question or issue they might like the group's brains on. <strong>[4 mins]</strong></li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A :</strong> The group asks the project holder rapid-fire questions to get more of the background. Both the questions and answers should be as concise as possible to maximise the number of questions answered. The Chef can intervene if someone is talking rather than questioning. <strong>[4 mins]</strong></li>
<li><strong>Burning question :</strong> The project holder articulates a focussed question or issue that they would like the group's help with. <strong>[1 min]</strong></li>
<li><strong>Discussion :</strong> The group holds a generative discussion of ideas to help the project holder with their identified issue. The project holder is not allowed to speak - they can only take notes. The Chef helps the discussion stay focussed and makes sure there is room for everyone's voice to be heard. <strong>[8 mins]</strong></li>
<li><strong>Harvest :</strong> The project holder reflects back to the group what was valuable and actionable from their discussion. <strong>[3 mins]</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rinse and repeat :</strong> Process is repeated for other projects on the table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check-out</strong> - Each person in the group is invited to talk briefly about their experience of the Project Kitchen process and what value they got out of it.</li>

<p>My take is always to accept interviews, but take some safeguards: Ask to be allowed to record it yourself. Start by interviewing them, so that you have a picture of where they are at with the story and which course they intends to steer it. If your guts tell you to trust them then tell your story. If not, politely excuse yourself saying that your work goes on a different direction that is not connected to that story.</p>
<p>Offer to help further, and without pushing for it, show availability to read their take on the interview before publishing. Most journalists feel nervous about that.</p>

<h3 id="opening-session"><a class="header" href="#opening-session">Opening session</a></h3>
<p>The opening and closing sessions are hugely important.</p>
<p>Context</p>
<ul>
<li>about the hosts and location</li>
<li>our agenda (where are we going on this journey?)</li>
<li>our objectives (what is the destination? e.g. new relationships, new collaborations)</li>
<li>"housekeeping" announcements, e.g. food, beds, comfort, health &amp; safety, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Circle</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing everyone's voice early on helps people arrive. It's very discouraging to spend a few days in an event without getting the opportunity to speak your mind to the group.</li>
<li>Many people will not raise their hand in a Q&amp;A session, so to get people talking, we always open with a round. For events up to 100 people, we sit everyone in a circle (everyone can see everyone) and go round speaking one at a time. In larger groups, we might break out into multiple circles.</li>
<li>If time is short, people can speak very briefly, e.g just answering, "What's your name? Where have you come from? What's one word to describe how you're feeling?" If there is more time, we would ask a bigger question like, "What do you want to get from this event? What do you want to contribute?" or "Tell us something about your home town."</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspiration</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the tone of the event with an inspirational talk, e.g. from one of the elders, or an upcoming young leader.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="closing-session"><a class="header" href="#closing-session">Closing session</a></h3>
<p>We always end the event with a closing circle, hearing once more from everyone. Prompting questions could be like "what was the most memorable experience?", "what is one new idea you're taking home?", "what action will you take when you get home" etc. Hearing about everyone's experiences adds a lot of impact as you begin to appreciate the great diversity of outcomes and intentions resulting from this gathering.</p>
<h3 id="forms"><a class="header" href="#forms">Forms</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the big circle, we use many different forms to encourage collaboration. For instance:</p>
<h4 id="open-space"><a class="header" href="#open-space">Open Space</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a> is a very specific and simple set of rules that allow a group to collaboratively decide how they want to spend their time together. Open Space works best when the hosts follow the rules exactly. Here's a short explanation to give you an idea, but I'd recommend reading more or talking with an expert:</p>
<p>Anyone can host any session: from a practical workshop, to a gaming session, outdoor recreation, or deep technical discussion.</p>
<p>We'd usually half a day (or sometimes much more) in Open Space. The available time is divided into slots, say 6x 40 minute slots for a half day.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a short (&lt;1 minute) pitch, explaining what they would like to host. They write their name and the name of their session on an index card, and announce where and when the session will start. All the cards are displayed on a big agenda on the wall, on a grid showing times and locations.</p>
<p>Then everyone can pick and choose which activities they're interested in. People are encouraged to only stay so long as they feel they are contributing. It's fine to move between simultaneous events happening at different locations.</p>
<h4 id="home-groups"><a class="header" href="#home-groups">Home groups</a></h4>
<p>Provide some structure to encourage people to make new relationships. E.g., if we have a large group, we'll break it up into smaller "home groups" of say 3-7 people with an intentional mix of ages, nationalities, skills etc. In the agenda, we have home group time periodically (e.g. once per day, or at the beginning, middle and end of the event).</p>
<p>Many people are much more comfortable participating in a small group than a large group. These home groups are an ideal way for people to reflect together on their experiences. They also allow for a much greater degree of intimacy, and more appreciation for diversity to develop between participants.</p>
<h3 id="principles"><a class="header" href="#principles">Principles</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Everybody contributes: this could be as simple as a roster for cleaning up after meals, or something a little bigger like hosting a warm up exercise to start the day. Minimise the distance between hosts and participants.</li>
<li>Emergence: leave plenty of space in the agenda for unexpected discussions and activities. You can never fully predict what is best for a group before they gather. Open Space is one of many techniques to foster this emergence.</li>
<li>Autonomy: make it easy for people to excuse themselves from a session, change the temperature for their comfort, or get refreshments when they're thirsty. Make it clear if some sessions are compulsory.</li>
<li>Diversity: account for the many different needs of participants. Some people are very energetic, others will need plenty of rest and quiet. Consider people's physical needs, e.g. diet and mobility.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logistics"><a class="header" href="#logistics">Logistics</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, we host events somewhere with a space big enough for everyone to work in at once. Also it is useful to have many small break-out rooms for teams to work together. Sleeping is usually in dorms (e.g. 8 people in one room) to save expense. Ideally the location will be nearby some recreational area, e.g. beach, river, park, walking tracks etc.</p>
<p>We try to spend minimal time in transport, i.e. spending almost all the time at one location, with perhaps one field trip. People in transit usually go into "waiting mode" rather than collaborating.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-patterns-1"><a class="header" href="#workshop-patterns-1">Workshop Patterns</a></h2>
<p><em>Here are some of the group processes use in Open Enspiral workshops. Explained with a brief description, plus some insights into why it works, or what principle it illustrates. Please add to this list and modify as you please :)</em></p>
<h3 id="check-in"><a class="header" href="#check-in">Check in</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> We start events with a check in. Everyone in a circle, sitting or standing (more energetic). Facilitator gives a prompt, then we go around and hear from everybody, e.g. how are you feeling on a scale 1-5?, or, what’s something you feel grateful for this morning? Remind people to be brief. Funny ice breaker questions can break tensions if the group doesn’t work together often (e.g. “each of you has a super power, what’s yours?”)</p>
<p>You can also invite people to say what they are looking forward to in the workshop or what they would like to get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Demonstrates that all voices are important. Also, we care about how you’re feeling.</p>
<h3 id="agendaprogrammetimeline"><a class="header" href="#agendaprogrammetimeline">Agenda/Programme/Timeline</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Ensure that a rough outline of the day is written up on the wall. Go through it in a bit of detail at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: This gives people a lay of the land and an overview of what to expect and how to orientate themselves in it.</p>
<h3 id="communication-protocol"><a class="header" href="#communication-protocol">Communication Protocol</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> Start by getting suggestions from the crowd: how should we communicate together? E.g. with generosity, care, fun, honesty, openness, respect, concise, joy, etc. Write them on a whiteboard. You can refer back to the whiteboard to remind people of our shared agreement, e.g. when you break from big group into small group discussions: "remember we said we would be kind and honest."</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> Makes our communication explicit, and malleable: something we can create intentionally, rather than just accepting a default from majority culture.</p>
<h3 id="twinkle-fingerssnaps"><a class="header" href="#twinkle-fingerssnaps">Twinkle fingers/snaps</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong> Introduce new ways of communication, e.g. you can sparkle/twinkle your fingers, or snap/click to show support or celebrate what someone has said. E.g. at the end of a talk, we all snap our fingers. Or in a small group, when someone says something that really moves me, I twinkle at them.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> This creative non-verbal communication takes up less time- and audio-space than clapping. Very easy introduction to the idea that different communication tools have different outcomes. And somehow it feels really great when a lot of people twinkle at you :)</p>
<h3 id="hand-up-mouth-shut"><a class="header" href="#hand-up-mouth-shut">Hand up-Mouth Shut</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Another great non-verbal communication trick. Introduce this process at the start of an event: When you want the room to be quiet, put your hand up and close your mouth. When you see someone with a hand up, you copy them: hands up, mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> A simple way to get the groups attention without having to lose your voice or clap or make some other crazy loud sound. Also, anyone can get the attention of the room, not just the facilitator.</p>
<h3 id="dot-voting"><a class="header" href="#dot-voting">Dot voting</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Get people to brainstorm ideas on post it notes, gather those post it notes on a wall. Then say that everyone has four dots to put on their favourite ones. The ones with the most dots will get picked.</p>
<p>Eg This could be used to decide which four topics you will cover in the afternoon</p>
<h3 id="1-2-4-all"><a class="header" href="#1-2-4-all">1-2-4-All</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>Share a story or present a question. Get people to reflect individually for one minute. Then they share reflections with another person for 2 minutes (1 minute each, facilitator signs when one minute has passed so that the other person can talk). Then bring them into groups of four for 4 minutes to share what resonates. Depending on the number of participants the same could be done in groups of 8 for 8 minutes. Facilitator makes sure everyone had the opportunity to talk and if someone is taking too much space in the conversation. The idea is to achieve consensus or consent in what resonates with the whole group and present back to all the participants. Facilitator takes notes of the group ideas in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>An accessible way of practicing collective decision-making. After that experience Loomio could be introduced as a tool that does a similar process online. Also a practice that could contribute to design a participatory workshop where groups choose the topics they would like to learn and facilitators customize the content and exercises to match the expectations of the participants.</p>
<h3 id="commitment-to-action"><a class="header" href="#commitment-to-action">Commitment to Action</a></h3>
<p>At the end of the event, everyone decides one thing they are going to do. Share it out loud to make a commitment in front of others.</p>
<h3 id="roomio"><a class="header" href="#roomio">Roomio</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> After you have introduced Loomio as an online concept show how you can also do it face to face. Explain what the thumb signals mean.</p>
<p>If you have time it can be great to break people up into smaller groups to discuss the differences between the different signals. Especially get them to talk about the difference between a "disagree" and "block".</p>
<h3 id="fishbowl-discussion"><a class="header" href="#fishbowl-discussion">Fishbowl discussion</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong> A fishbowl discussion is suited to large groups. To set up the conversation, place 5 chairs in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. Select four people to occupy chairs in the fishbowl, and leave one seat unoccupied. Only people occupying chairs in the fishbowl are allowed to speak. The audience members sit or stand around the fishbowl and listen to the discussion. At any time, a member of the audience can join the discussion by occupying the empty chair in the fishbowl. When this happens, an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free up another chair. The discussion progresses with people freely entering and leaving the fishbowl.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> This format emphasises Enspiral’s ethic of self-responsibility within a large group. If someone has certain needs/wants for how the discussion unfolds, then they have the opportunity to voice that need and/or steer the discussion accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="human-spectogram"><a class="header" href="#human-spectogram">Human Spectogram</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>People show where they stand on a spectrum— sometimes an issue with two extremes— by moving to the point between the two spatially-designated points that reflects their views (this side of the room is "strongly agree"... opposite side is "strongly disagree"); facilitator asks people from each extreme and from the middle to share with the group why they are standing where they are. There are <a href="http://www.conferencesthatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chapter-33-Human-spectrograms_s.pdf">tweaks and additional resources here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>This supports those who are better kinesthetic and/or visual-spatial learners. It is a way for the group to get a better sense of the diverse opinions and experiences within itself. Getting up and moving around can be a good way to add some energy to a workshop and can be a useful transition.</p>
<h3 id="stewardship-exercise"><a class="header" href="#stewardship-exercise">Stewardship exercise</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>Introduce the concept of the <a href="guides/archive/stewarding.html">Stewardship</a> process adopted in Enspiral and the importance of having a specific time and regular rhythm to share with another colleague your needs and aspirations. Divide the group into pairs and give them 6 minutes to share what they need to do their best work. Facilitator signs after 3 minutes so that the other person can talk. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByI0xI66ttpMYnlVTXpMN1VtTmc">Here</a> is an example of a Stewardship exercise with a network of consultants.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>An accessible way of practicing peer-to-peer support and understanding how personal development and support can happen in a decentralised network.</p>
<h3 id="retrospective"><a class="header" href="#retrospective">Retrospective</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: At the end of the workshop run a retrospective</p>
<p>How you do this tends to depend on how much time you have and how much trust you have built within the participants. One way is to give everyone three post it notes and on one they write something like likes, one something they did not like, and something they would recommend to change.</p>
<h3 id="letter-to-self"><a class="header" href="#letter-to-self">Letter to self</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Invite people to write a letter to their future self. You can encourage them to write something to remind them of today, to make a commitment to their future self</p>
<h3 id="team"><a class="header" href="#team">Team</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Ensure all the team have introduced them self</p>
<h3 id="check-out"><a class="header" href="#check-out">Check out</a></h3>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: If there is time at the end, end like you began and do a check out. You could ask: What are you leaving with? What was your key insight?</p>

<p>This chapter compiles existing Enspiral Nodes.</p>
<p>An Enspiral node is a formal subgroup of Enspiral that has the power to manage their agreements, processes and finances independently.</p>
<p>If you want to start a node in Enspiral, a good place to start is reading the <a href="nodes//agreements/nodes">Node Agreement</a> which outlines all the formal requirements to get officially approved by the board. You might also benefit from the documentation of the existing nodes, and having a conversation with their representatives. Good luck ✨</p>

<p>Anyone can start a working group. Working groups are where we do work on the network. Often a working group will be initiated by someone with high context but low capacity for action (e.g. directors or catalysts), and then they'll recruit contributors with more capacity. Working groups will often be temporary, though some will be permanent.</p>
<p>Catalysts will keep an overview of all active working groups, and clear out the inactive ones on a quarterly cycle.</p>
<p>Standard operating procedure for working groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a <strong>name</strong>, e.g. "Assembly Sprint Working Group"</li>
<li>have a <strong>scope</strong>, e.g. "Take the Board's recommendations about Foundation finances and turn them into decisions."</li>
<li><strong>membership</strong>: a named list of people who are in, plus a way for people to join, if appropriate</li>
<li>have a page in the <strong>handbook</strong> sharing this basic overview</li>
<li>a <strong>Slack channel</strong> using the <code>wg-</code> naming convention, e.g. #wg-financial (and optionally, a private Slack channel #wg-financial-private). The #wg-all channel is a place to connect with all people active in working groups.</li>
<li><strong>reporting</strong>: post updates in the public Slack channel and in the newsletter</li>
<li>involve people in <strong>decisions</strong> on Loomio. (Tagging Loomio threads with the <code>wg-</code> label will make them easier to find.)</li>
<li><strong>task tracking</strong>: we use the Improvements board for task tracking. Read the <a href="working-groups/improvements.html">Improvements Guide</a> and talk to the Catalysts if you'd like hands-on support.</li>
<li><strong>rhythm</strong>: align to the two-weekly sprint rhythm set by the Catalysts (e.g, sprint 15 starts on Monday Oct 31.) The sprint rhythm corresponds to the "milestones" on the Improvements board. All active tasks on the Improvements board have a Milestone, i.e. which sprint to we expect to finish the work.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can take as much of this structure as is useful!</p>

<p>We are a small group of members and contributors committed to our yearly gatherings and – increasingly – all of Enspiral's vital gatherings, year round.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our work is to care for the heartbeat of Enspiral.</li>
<li>Our work is to create and hold space for connection and cultivation and nurturance, to ground our work and give it wings.</li>
<li>Our work is essentially manaakitanga (<a href="https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&amp;phrase=&amp;proverb=&amp;loan=&amp;histLoanWords=&amp;keywords=manaakitanga">defined here as</a> hospitality, kindness, generosity, support…) and the work that creates the conditions in which another's mana may grow.</li>

<h2 id="membership-and-participation"><a class="header" href="#membership-and-participation">Membership and Participation</a></h2>
<p>Each gathering will typically have its own crew, or "project group". The core members of this Working Group are committed to participate in the pods for the next two gatherings (Winter Retreat 2019 and Summer Fest 2020) and seek to establish the foundations for future retreat pods to better and more easily run our key gatherings. This also means cultivating a sustainable Working Group and planning for our own succession.</p>

<p>6.6 The representative of a corporate shareholder is entitled to attend and be heard at a meeting of shareholders as if the representative were the shareholder.</p>
<p>6.7 A shareholder may not exercise the right to vote at a meeting by casting a postal vote.</p>

<p><strong>7.WRITTEN SHAREHOLDERS’ RESOLUTION INSTEAD OF HOLDING A MEETING</strong></p>

<p>The Directors must elect one of their number as chairperson of the Board.</p>
<p><strong>13.CHAIRPERSON TO HOLD OFFICE ON CERTAIN TERMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>14.MEETINGS OF THE BOARD</strong></p>
<p>The Third Schedule to the Act with the following exceptions does apply to proceedings of the Board unless all the Directors present at any board meeting agree that it will not apply to that meeting:</p>
<p>Clause 4 (1) of the Third Schedule does not apply, and the following is substituted: “A quorum is 60% of the current number of directors, rounded up to the nearest number.”</p>
<p>Clause 3 of the Third Schedule does not apply, and the following is substituted:</p>
<p>“A meeting may be held by means of audio/visual connection between the Board members, or by use of any software programme via which the shareholders unanimously agree the Board may conduct its business.”</p>
<p><strong>15.BOARD DELEGATES TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS</strong></p>

<p>The provisions of this constitution relating to proceedings of the Board also apply to proceedings of any committee of Directors, except to the extent the Board determines otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>17.INTERESTED DIRECTOR MUST NOT VOTE</strong></p>
<p>A Director of the Company who is interested in a transaction entered into, or to be entered into, by the Company must not vote on a matter relating to the transaction, but otherwise may act in his or her capacity as a Director in relation to the transaction as if he or she were not interested in the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>18.BOARD’S POWER TO AUTHORISE REMUNERATION AND OTHER BENEFITS IS LIMITED</strong></p>
<p>The Board may authorise payments or actions under section 161 of the Act only if the relevant payment or action has been approved by ordinary resolution or with the prior written agreement or concurrence of all entitled persons. This clause does not apply to the payment of remuneration or the provision of other benefits to an executive Director in his or her capacity as an executive or to any other Director in respect of any professional services provided by that Director to the Company.</p>
<p><strong>19.DIRECTORS MAY APPOINT AND REMOVE ALTERNATE DIRECTORS</strong></p>

<p>19.2 remove that person from that office, by giving written notice to that effect to the Company.</p>
<p><strong>20.ALTERNATE DIRECTOR</strong></p>
<p>20.1 While acting in the place of the Director who appointed him or her, the alternate Director:</p>
<p>20.1.1 has, and may exercise and discharge, all the powers, rights, duties and privileges of that Director (including the right to receive notice of, be counted as part of the quorum of, participate in, and vote at a meeting of the Board and to sign any document, including a written resolution, and to act as chairperson of the Board, but excluding the right to appoint an alternate Director).</p>
<p>20.1.2 is also subject to the same terms and conditions of appointment as that Director, except in respect of remuneration.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="board-of-directors"><a class="header" href="#board-of-directors">Board of Directors</a></h1>
<p>As a registered New Zealand company, Enspiral Foundation Ltd has to have directors. Enspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so the board has a narrow focus. You can see the details in the <a href="https://handbook.enspiral.com/agreements/board">Board Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>{% hint style="info" %}</p>
<p>With recent changes to Enspiral membership and emergence of <a href="foundation//agreements/nodes.html">nodes</a> the role of the board in the network is currently in transition.</p>
<p>{% endhint %}</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal and financial compliance</li>
<li>Management of major risk</li>
<li>Steward of the Enspiral brand</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oversee the Foundation’s financial accounts</li>
<li>Make agreements between the Enspiral Foundation and other entities (MOUs, Service contracts)</li>
<li>Occasionally make recommendations or raise issues to the members or the network as a whole</li>
<li>Have some emergency powers to use in rare crisis situations if our other processes have broken down</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reporting</strong></p>
<p>The board reports regularly to the network as a whole <a href="https://www.loomio.org/d/oFN6x8t5/re-introducing-the-enspiral-foundation-mvb-board-of-directors-">on Loomio</a>, and participates quarterly venture reporting (since Enspiral Foundation Ltd is itself an Enspiral Venture).</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The scope board is that the scope is limited - the board specifically focuses on Enspiral Foundation Ltd (not the entire Enspiral network), and within that only governance.</p>
<p>Examples of things within scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>an MOU between the Enspiral Foundation and an external organisation</li>
<li>an issue with one of the Foundation’s service contracts (such as Enspiral Ops)</li>
<li>a serious concern about brand or reputation risk, or if you’re unsure when it’s OK to use Enspiral’s brand publicly</li>
<li>a question about running a transaction through the Foundation’s bank account</li>
</ul>

<p>Money at Enspiral is governed by the <a href="money/../agreements/financial.html">Financial Agreement</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collaborative-funding-2"><a class="header" href="#collaborative-funding-2">Collaborative Funding</a></h1>
<p>At Enspiral, we are using facilitated <a href="https://cobudget.com">cobudget</a> rounds to decide on how to distribute money and fund projects within the network.</p>
<p>Anyone in the network can propose a project (we call it "bucket") to be funded and anyone in the network can choose to participate in distributing the funds allocated for the cobudget round.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGuObGipb0A">short video</a> (2m37) with the overview of the cobudget round.</p>
<h2 id="general-funding-round-process"><a class="header" href="#general-funding-round-process">General funding round process</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>The board decides on having the cobudget round and allocates funds (eg. 20k NZD)</li>
<li>Facilitator(s) rise their hands to facilitate the process, scope the details and communicate them to the network via Loomio (eg. focus of the round, key dates, important links etc). The round is setup inside <a href="https://cobudget.com/enspiral">Enspiral Foundation Cobudget</a> (private link) - make sure you get admin access t setup the round.</li>
<li>Facilitator(s) invite people in the network to rise their hands to distribute allocated money. The allocated money is divided equally between all participants.</li>
<li>Anyone in the network can propose a bucket to get funded, within the scope of the round. Bucket holders provide description of their bucket and requested amount to fund it directly in cobudget.</li>
<li>When the funding round starts all participants distribute their chunk of funds as they desire. It is possible to allocate money to your own project and it is possible not to allocate any money at all and return it to the Enspiral Fundation.</li>
<li>When the funding process is finished facilitators check in with bucket holders - if the bucket is funded do they accept the money and if the bucket is not funded do they accept partial funding.</li>
<li>Bucket holders that accepted the funding or partial funding deliver their project and submit an invoice to Enspiral Foundation on delivery.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contributing-money-to-enspiral"><a class="header" href="#contributing-money-to-enspiral">Contributing Money to Enspiral</a></h1>
<h2 id="gifts-from-individuals"><a class="header" href="#gifts-from-individuals">Gifts from Individuals</a></h2>
<p>Gifts from individuals are made using post tax money and are not tax deductible.</p>
<h2 id="gifts-from-businesses"><a class="header" href="#gifts-from-businesses">Gifts from Businesses</a></h2>
<p>Gifts from business are not tax deductible, unlike yearly contributor fees or monthly venture fees.</p>
<p>Because business gifts are paid with pre-tax funds, the business will need to keep 28% aside for the future tax bill.</p>
<p>For the initial release of the Variable Contribution process, the gift amount entered by businesses is treated as the post-tax amount after 28% has been set aside for tax.</p>
<p>For example, if a business enters $100 into the Variable Contribution Form it will keep an additional $38.89 (28%) set aside for tax.</p>
<h2 id="business-tax-component-calculation"><a class="header" href="#business-tax-component-calculation">Business Tax Component Calculation</a></h2>
<p>Businesses gifting funds to Enspiral Foundation are responsible for setting aside and managing tax on donations. Businesses can calculate the tax to keep aside using this formula:</p>
<p><strong>($x / (1-.28))-$x</strong></p>
<p><strong>$100 gift example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>($100/.72)-$100 = $38.89.</li>
<li>Foundation receives $100.</li>
<li>Business keeps $38.89 aside for tax.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>$350 gift example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>($350/.72)-$350 = $136.11 tax.</li>
<li>Foundation receives $350.</li>
<li>Business keeps $136.11 aside for tax.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="financial-transparency"><a class="header" href="#financial-transparency">Financial Transparency</a></h1>
<p>How money works at Enspiral is determined by the <a href="money/../agreements/financial.html">Financial Agreement</a>. This page is to provide information and transparency about our financial situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.loomio.com/d/SoNn7pb5/enspiral-foundations-ltd-financials">This post on Loomio</a> includes regular financial updates.</p>
<h3 id="bank-accounts"><a class="header" href="#bank-accounts">Bank Accounts</a></h3>
<p>EF has six bank accounts in Kiwibank:</p>
<p><strong>Income and expenses</strong><br />
Money in this account has been pre-allocated to future spending and is not for allocation to any new projects. This includes money allocated to 10 years of Lifehack website hosting (final payment April 2028, hosting to expire March 31, 2029).</p>
<p>For 2021 financial year this account will "rest" at <strong>$7,520</strong> at the start of each month. Any money above this amount will be transferred to the mission account. Each year, due to LifehackHQ account, this "resting" figure will reduce by $740 until the lifehackhq website hosting expense expires on 31 March 2029. The above figure of $7,520 includes the first two year's worth of payments (and as such, the 'resting balance' has reduced accordingly by two lots of $740 from $9,000).</p>
<p><strong>Mission Account</strong><br />
This money is money beyond the runway and is unallocated.<br />
It is money accessible for projects/jobs that progress the mission of "more people working on stuff that matters".<br />
Proposals to access this money are created through an advice process with the community and then go to the board for final consent.</p>
<p><strong>Collab funding</strong><br />
Money in this account has been allocated to collaborative funding processes and outcomes of those processes.</p>
<p><strong>Working groups account</strong><br />
The Working groups account holds money allocated to specific working groups. Ops can provide the budget allocations to each working group at any point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Gatherings account</strong>
in 2021 the Gathering's funds have been separated out from the general working group account to make it more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Runway Saver</strong><br />
This bank account holds 12 months of fixed operating expenses to create spare capacity purposively to accommodate future disruption.<br />
(<em>Example; Balancing the books crisis that the Enspiral community went through in 2016-2018, where the revenue model for the community dried up and our expenses maintained which meant that we were quickly losing money and going into a state of bankruptcy.</em>)<br />
As of 14 June 2021 the average outgoings for the previous 12 months were $3100 per month with a total of $34,959.<br />
If the core expenses increase (eg $100 per month for website) then then runway saver account needs to be increased accordingly to represent 12 months of this new figure. However, at the current time, the balance is $44,837 which is 14 months runway.
This money is not accessible for new project spending<br />
The account is a savings account which requires 30 days to get access to the money.</p>
<h3 id="income-1"><a class="header" href="#income-1">Income</a></h3>
<p>EF receives money from five sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individual contributions via Subscriptions</li>
<li>Venture Contributions</li>
<li>CoBudget</li>
<li>Google Workspace Subscriptions (these should be close to cost-neutral)</li>
<li>Sponsorship to WG-Catalysts</li>
<li>Gatherings surpluses</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="expenses"><a class="header" href="#expenses">Expenses</a></h3>
<p>EF spends money generally in the following areas:</p>
<p>Accounting and Operations<br />
Software services (loomio, domain registration etc)<br />
Google Workspace<br />
Collab funding<br />
Newsletter</p>
